groupe_1,"We are veterans to the Center Parcs holiday and have visited all the UK ones and 2 in France.  However this is our first return visit for 3 years where we were once twice yearly regulars.  That's the context done.  Center Parcs have gradually dismantled there own brand in favour of high street franchises.  These are priced pretty much the same as high street; if you can get in them.  Arrival day; car park full by 11:50 so sent to park by villa, never known this before.  Arrival day lunch, waited over 1 hour for some burgers and kids meals but the food was ok.  Subtropical swim paradise; very busy, make sure you all get key bands as these open the pool lockers and your lodge.  Around 30% of the showers in the pool area don't work and several lockers also did not lock.  The rapids were so busy at one point they had to control the flow of people with lifeguards.  Water to drink is freely available at the bars in the pool area, this is good to know.  Park mart well stocked although more to the processed food end of things.We did the DiningIn service the next day but this fell short as they could not cook the burgers due to oven failure.  However you can see the Dexter's burger restaurant almost from the door of dining in counter.  So I sorted it myself.  Climbing experience much improved from previous visits and we all enjoyed some badminton.  Tried for pancake house at lunch on leaving day but 40 min wait for table despite the place looking half full.The lodge was a basic one,  however the tv had some screen damage, the towel loop in the loo was broken off and one of the 2 fridges was dirty.I waited 10 minutes in the leisure bowl bar to be served which was again half full.Overall impression; some facilities improved but it does not seem to have that feeling of attentive service any more and there is not enough staff to keep things moving on time whilst they have clearly increased the Parc accommodation numbers.  Profit I fear has come before pride in the Center Parcs culture.  It may be a long time before we consider a visit to this brand again.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0
groupe_1,"Lodge was fine, nice setting, centre is well laid out, easy to push a wheelchair or buggy. The Aqua Sana spa was excellent, crowded but not uncomfortably so. Great fireworks on the Saturday night. Swim paradise was packed but this is to be expected on a chilly December day. My main gripe is the poor level of service. Some examples: non-functioning locker key; no towels in the swim paradise; no balls in our bowling lane; nearly an hour to get some very bad food in one of the restaurants (with a single owner of all the food franchises and a captive market I guess it isn't surprising that none of them tries too hard). Individual staff members were mostly cheery and helpful but there wasn't nearly enough of them. It would have been OK if this had been a cheap break. But it wasn't. Over ¬£200 a night per room and everything else extra. Appreciate it was a peak period, but for this kind of money you expect faultless service.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,1.0

groupe_1,"We have visited Centre Parcs many times over the past 20+ years but this time (2nd-4th January 2019) has put most of our family off returning again unless the company does something to sort out the overcrowding issue. It felt dangerously overcrowded, which we felt was due to new guest arriving whilst checked out guests were allowed to stay, and on top of this there were no activities available on &quot;cross-over days&quot; which left the sub- tropical area the place for everyone to go to. Whilst management tried to put strategies in place to eliviate the issue, such as stopping guests entering the area/blocking off areas, it was too little too late for those caught up in the chaos inside the sub-tropical area and resulted in our group leaving early.

groupe_1,"We stayed as a family group from 2nd January until 4th January 2019.  On two of the days out of our three-day long stay, the sub-tropical paradise swim pool was 'full' which resulted in staff having to create a make-shift barricade across the entrance to stop holidaymakers from accessing the facility!  There was an enormous queue of families loaded up with swimming gear who were being constantly turned away with crying toddlers and harassed parents looking disappointed and angry.  It was impossible to book a restaurant for dinner on either of our two night stay due to all the restaurants being fully booked!  Queues everywhere - 45-minute wait for a table to eat breakfast followed by a further hour sat at the table waiting for food.  Long lines for the bathrooms which were then overloaded and not flushing.  The queues to buy a coffee were literally out the door and there appeared to be a general lack of staff everywhere across the park.  Toilets in public areas were frequently blocked throughout our stay with staff appearing to be as overwhelmed as the plumbing was.  Never before had an experience like this at Center Parcs.  I can only imagine a decision had been made somewhere to maximise the amount of money Center Parcs could make by increasing holidaymaker numbers whilst failing to increase staff numbers and then being completely unable to ensure access to all facilities for everyone who had paid for what is actually quite an expensive break.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0

groupe_1,"This was our 8th or 9th visit to Center Parcs, Sherwood Forest and unfortunately I don't think we'll be going back for a while (if at all).  In the past we have loved it, couldn't fault it but this time it was far too busy, far too many people and a struggle to get a seat in both Starbucks and the Sports Cafe. We like to book activities when we get there to see what we fancy but we couldn't. On our arrival day we couldn't enter the pool as it was at capacity and on our last day the pool was closed for quite some time due to either a 'technical fault' 'health and safety' 'plant matter leaking in the water' - all three reasons given by different staff. We were told that the pool may not open at all and then it did, seconds after.  Guest services although pleasant, not helpful, their response was 'Center Parcs reserves the right to close any attraction due to health and safety reasons', typical management response. I do understand the reasons behind closing the pool and I wasn't there to complain, I wanted to know the likelihood of the pool opening before deciding to leave the complex to go home.Everywhere was packed, no-one had a lodge to go to, those arriving couldn't access their lodge and those leaving had checked out, it was chaos in every building and play area. Very stressful.My personal view is that too many new lodges are being built therefore more people in a complex that cannot handle them during peak school holidays. We have loved Center Parcs over the years and our children have made many memories. It was always a chilled, relaxing family break but this time it was far from it, too many people, too busy and not enough space for everyone.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0

We know what we like to do and had booked 2 evening meals and bowling in advance. We also played adventure golf, which was fun but very cold, badminton and a 2nd game of bowling. Plus plenty of time in the pool and chilling at Starbucks and our lodge.The only negative,which didn't affect our enjoyment but was a noticeable change from our last stay 2 years ago, was just how busy the whole parc was. We even had to wait 15 minutes to enter the subtropical paradise which was a first. I hope Center Parcs aren't trying to pack as many people in as possible to the detriment of all visitors.

Driving range has disappeared as it's all built on! There seems to be so much less forest and green areas, which ruins the concept of it.

groupe_1,"It's just a year since our last visit to Sherwood and it's obvious just how busy it is especially since this was just after new year when all the children are back at school. I dread to think how  it will be in the school summer holidays. We made the mistake last year of not booking restaurants each night, not realising that only part of some are kept open, and were told waiting times were 90 minutes. This year we booked and restaurants were busy. With so many extra villas being built, the services are going to struggle. Lunchtimes seem to be very quiet in some restaurants - Bella Italia had only about 4 tables in one day, and the food was surprisingly good. We could see into the pool and it was heaving! We opted for an executive apartment, 913, this time and we amazed by how spacious it was, and how luxurious and comfortable. It's much bigger than a 2 bed lodge and not a lot different in price. The only snag is having to walk through the carpark to get anywhere, but we got used to that. You do get a designated parking space close to the apartments The select guest vouchers are still an issue almost 2 years on. We had to collect them from guest services only to be told we'd have to call back as they'd run out! Our meal at Hucks  was a disappointment - tough steaks, which aren't cheap, so you expect quality. Our waitress was brilliant and sympathetic. She took one off the bill as she could see a lot was left on the plate.I've always loved my trips to Center Parcs but with the woods and open spaces disappearing under more villas at each visit, I can see the time when we stop visiting. TBH the only thing that stops us changing to Forest  holidays is the lack of restaurants there.

groupe_1,"We have always loved Center parcs, staying in the forest is lovely and the accommodation is always great comfortable and well maintained.  We enjoy some of the sporting activities as well as cycling and the pool.  We have become disappointed with the pool at sherwood.  On our trip just after new year but still in the schoool holidays the pool area was overly busy, uncomfortably so.  There were large queues for the slides some for half an hour the outside pool was very busy and the rapids crowded making it feel unsafe.  The changing rooms were far too busy, we had to wait about 20 minutes on getting out of the pool for a changing cubicle the number of these needs to be doubled.  There is a small shared changing area which we also used that was very crowded.  The main wave pool was a bit cooler than we would like.Overall this put us off going back to Center parcs especially in the school holidays as the pool areas are one of the main reasons we go.  The kids were even put off which really shows how bad it was.  I (and several other people at the pool) felt that the main problem is that many more villas have been built but the pool areas haven't been expanded to accommodate.  At sherwood a new slide has been built but wasn't yet open, however I can't see this would have made much difference.  The pool areas need to be massively expanded.  We may try and go again but not in the school holidays and might try whinwell forest instead.  Center parcs you have over built and spoilt what was a lovely holiday in nature with some lovely facilities.We also had an issue with a pre booked takeaway order.  We ordered a Chinese and they tried to give us Indian instead.  After a couple of calls we finally got our food about an hour late and the quality of it was very disappointing.  We ended up getting a full refund the next day which we appreciated.  Food in the restaurants we ate in was good ( pancake house, Italian and the country in). Service was also good at these venues.  The supermarket has a good selection of items although some of it a bit pricey.Overall we've had some lovely holidays at Center parcs but think the days are numbered.

With it being dog friendly I would have been nice to have the patio bit fenced off to let them out there for some fresh air, but they did have a metal ring where you could tie your dog too. There was a dog park over the road from us which was handy for the dogs to get a bit of off lead time, but it wasn't very big so they couldn't really run around. A lot of dog owners not picking up after their dogs though so had to make sure we didn't stand in anything when cleaning up after our own. We took them in to the entrance of the jardin des sports and sat with them whilst we played pool with no problems. They weren't allowed inside anywhere else though. We also took them to archery and was able to take them in to the hut where we were shooting from as one of our party wasn't taking part &amp; could sit with them. Swimming pool was very busy, and not enough changing cubicles, we found ourselves waiting ages for someone to come out but then there was a few people fighting for each changing cubicle. So we only ended up going once. We also used the shuttle bus for my brother in law who is disabled &amp; can't walk far.

When we drove in I liked the festive touches of Christmas Trees and fake snow truly magical for our little daughter. Getting our keys to lodge was quick and easy. Parked the car and decided to go for a drink and a swim before we could get in to the lodge. We headed to the sports bar on foot and loved all the fairy lights, singing reindeer's, made us all feel very festive. The sports bar was very busy but managed to get a table. Swimming is always brilliant at Center Parcs but family changing room could be bigger.The lodge we stayed in was pine 357. To be honest was slightly disappointed with the Lodge. Its too small for four adults and two toddlers. You do get under each others feet. We also found ants in the lodge which is a shame. This isn't a huge criticism as we spent a lot of time swimming and at the sports plaza. But this could be improved.All in all a good stay, enjoyed all the festive decorations around the forest, swimming, and having a drink. Be warned though if you want to watch football in Sports bar get their early and have plenty of beer vouchers ¬£5.50 a pint!

Went to collect our bikes and cleaners were just finishing when we returned to our lodgeLodge lovely and clean and cleaners helped us with a couple of extras we needed. Wildlife was great, a real love of our Center Parcs holidays (better at Sherwood than whinfell generally) a swan was very persistent knocking on our door for food!! ud83dude02Took the cars back, parked up no problem then plodded at the lodge until it was time for tea, went to hucks which was a little disappointing (the kids buffet mainly, ordered something else in the end) but not enough to complain about - back to the lodge - nice comfy sleep for all.Tuesday - kabana at the pool, good as usual, pool not too busy and a bit on the cool side but the little one enjoyed it. (Kids area is getting a well needed revamp soon) lunch by the pool was very nice too.Afternoon - adventure golf &amp; kids playground Did fajitas in the lodge for tea, all the kit we needed was there.Wednesday pottery painting for all the family - always good - Bella italia for lunch - really nice &amp; not busy Quick game of pool @ the country club and a couple of beers in the afternoon &amp; Bowling too - then a takeaway for tea (there was a limited menu on the week we were there, quite limited but not a problem for us, we're not fussy) games night at the lodge.Thursday - off road explorers for the little one, (not as good a coarse as Whinfell but still good fun) cafe rouge for a light lunch - very nice &amp; very quiet again - potterd round the village square before a lovely Indian in the evening.Friday - pack up - park cars (which took a good 25 mins - very busy) then had a final stroll &amp; look round the shops then early lunch at the pancake house (always go early as even then it's always packed - we had a 45 minute wait for a table but expected this so carried on shopping while we waited) foods always very nice and is a final day ritual of ours - back home in an hour and sad to have finished another lovely holiday - take me back!! TipsBook activities and restaurants in advance - not only does this guarantee your place but you've already paid some or all of the balance so you don't feel like you're spending too much while you're thereTake some food with you but don't go mad - the shop is not as expensive as some people make out - get wine, beer and food staples &amp; extra loo rolls before you go then Top up with little luxuries Expect to pay airport prices for most things - it's not rocket science - they have a captive audience so prices are 25% higher than you'd expect, all menus are available to view on the app/website so don't be caught out. Finally, worry about what you spend afterwards - just go and enjoy yourself first - the activities, accommodation, service and surroundings are excellent and we never feel ripped off as we have such a good time, if you go with one eye on how much you're spending you'll hate it!

Then again we have never been when the kids have been off school!! OMG never again!  We went the first weekend of January (4th u2013 7th Jan).   It was ridiculously busy u2013 I think Center Parcs seriously need to consider changing their rules on when the guests should leave the site on checking out date.  When there are u201cdoubleu201d the people there on change over day it is just ridiculous.  No room in any of the restaurants, ridiculous queues everywhere you go, getting turned away at the swimming pool because it was so busy, nowhere to park in the car park.  I think they need to seriously change it so that on arrival day you can come as early as you wish but on checking out day you need to be off site by 12 p.m.  On checking in at the gate they did say the rules had changed and you can now park at your villa straight away which was great if you get there early enough u2013 I am assuming this is because of the problem of not finding a car parking space in the car park. I feel the cleaning of the rooms seriously needs to be stepped up.  On first look they do look clean but I lost an earring down the side of the sofa and I wish I hadn't looked yuk!  Hair down the plug hole, dirt down the sides of the radiators, under the beds, a rusty nail in the bathroom used as the door stop because the door stop had come off, just filthy underneath the sofas  u2013 for the price you pay I expected more.

On arrival the lodge was lovely and clean and well presented. It wasn't untill I started to unpack and we settled in that we started to notice a few faults with our lodge. We had struggled to get the downstairs of our lodge warm (the upstairs was very warm) and thought maybe the lodge took a while to heat up downstairs. After an hour or 2 by this time it was around 6:30 7 pm. The radiators has still not managed to warm up and the downstairs was rather chilly. I called guest services and they arranged for an engineer to come out and have a look for us . He was extremely helpful and managed to sort the heating. Apparently the system prioritises warning the hot tub over the downstairs heating which we found a little odd but we was happy as around 9pm the lodge had warmed up. During this time though we started to hear a strange noise comming from out side which was in fact the hot tub. I once again called guest services and they said someone would be sent out out . We had to wait a while and a few more phone calls were made to them but they did come out. The hot tub was only half full and a pump had gone down and needed to be replaced . We was really disappointed by this stage as we had spent a lot of money on this lodge and the whole idea of having the hot tub and especially after a long day of travelling and entertaining the children was to be able to relax in the hot tub. We was therefor unable to use this on the first day of our stay which is very disappointing . Admittedly though by the time we was awake in the morning the problem had been resolved which we was impressed by and grateful for as the children were desperate to use the hot tub. I just feel it's such a shame we was unable to use it for the first day of our stay when this is something we expected to be able to use instantly.We also started to noctice around the lodge that there are many things that have been come tired looking or broken. For example the window catches in the upstairs double bedroom were completely broken so there was no safety catches on them which was a worry with having children in the lodge all week.The sofa also was very tired and worn and did not represent luxury at all and this really was what we thought we was goin to get but in our eyes and speaking to others guests in the same lodges they also felt the same with other things in the lodge also like the messy untidy paintwork ect. There was also an awful creek sound every time you walked around in the upstairs bedroom, which annoyin especially when the young children was sleeping as we thought this may have woken them up. Towards getting to the end off our stay we also noticed that there appeared to be a rather strong smell of drains esp in the steam room sauna area and toilet which was starting to become. unpleasant.We just feel really let down as the lodge wasn't quite what we expected esp when looking on your website at photos ect. We have stayed in a few different lodges at cp now and feel the the standard of the other ones compared to Ash 46  were probably better internally decor wise and also presentation wise with having less tired looking sofas ect than the exclusive lodge Ash 46 we stayed in .We absolutely love comming to visit centre Parcs as for us it creates such wonder memories and gives us precious family time which we really don't get enough of. On this occasion though We feel we was really let down by the standard and quality of our Villa . Everything else at CP was wonderful as ever we were just very disappointed by the quality of our lodge .",1.0,-1.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0

The four of us (myself, Wife and 2 kids) had an amazing time, which is to be expected as every time we stayed at Center Parcs we have an amazing time.We are frequent Center Parcs visitors, either to Elveden, Sherwood or winfelt. However Elveden has always been our favorate. The place is well spaced out, busy but not too overcrowded and as expected from Center Parcs the staff are always friendly and helpful.The winter wonderland experience for the kids is very magical and I think that Elveden does it best. The santa's Workshop is really well laid out and all the decorations and lighting make it very special for the kids. The fireworks display was awsome and as we stayed for 7 days we where lucky to see it twice.We visited Hucks, pancake house, sports bar, cafe rouge and Bella Italia and all where great, no issues with anything, food quality brill, staff brill etc etc.All the activities are good and the staff who run them are really enthusiastic and encourage the kids to get the best out of them. It would help if some of the availability was increased and certain things are booked up quick or are not available on certain days. The SSP is really nice, by far the best out of the 3 CP's we visit, no issue getting into changing cublicals and again the staff always so very helpful.We stayed in a 3 bed woodland lodge which was clean, well maintained and functional, concidering we where out all day every day it does not seem worth paying more for the upgraded villa's, its great for a cosy night in after the kids had gone to bed, and that's exactly what we wanted.

That said the kids had a great time with their friends. One big gripe is the price for a drink. We had a nice walk out to the country club for a nice relaxing drink but nearly needed a medic after seeing the prices.. your almost as expensive as london! My other big issue was how much traffic was still in the park?

My older grandson did Christmas cup cake decorating which was really good and you get to keep four cupcakes too. We booked a festive pony ride in the woods for my oldest grandson, which he really enjoyed. We went swimming and did mini jet ski's and paid a visit to see Santa in his Winter Wonderland on our last day, Found all the activities to be excellent. On our last day we visited Hucks restaurant which was reasonable value for money, especially the children's meals. Tvetyhnjbg we had was well cooked and tasty with plenty to choose from. We found all the staff on the parc very courteous and friendly with people serving in the village shop to the cleaners in the lodges. The Lodge we stayed in was very clean and Leo The fireworks on Saturday evening were of a very high standard and the best I've ever seen.

groupe_1,"We did a midweek break just before Xmas. Executive lodge.  3 ensuite rooms which was good. Each room had a tv although the tv in the lounge area is small.  Only 7 channels - no freeview channels which was very disappointing. Lodge was very clean and we had daily housekeeping.  Private sauna is good. Spa bath in bedroom 1 is good - but if others want to use it they have to go into the master bedroom.   Bedrooms are 'cosy ' in size and beds very soft. Not to my liking and I went home with backache.  We took quite a bit of food with us - cooking facilities are adequate.  Supermarket has a fair range of items and prices are ok.  We ate out one evening - at the foresters inn.  It was dreadful- very poor slow service and food was cold / inedible.  We received a refund for the main courses but that didn't compensate for a horrible, spoilt evening.  Our grandson did the elf academy and the pirate adventure.  He loved both and they were great value for money.   The tropical swimming pool is very good - and free. The spa is good but expensive.  We much prefer the spa at Woburn- many more rooms with much more variety and a much better spa pool there.   Very peaceful place - with the exception of the jet engines from nearby RAF which make occasional bursts of noise.  Many activities are available but all very expensive- wouldn't do executive lodge again - way too much more for few extras.  Fireworks were good - although much of the display was Halloween themed and there was no Christmas music ?  Decorations around the village were beautiful.

The villa on the other hand was disgusting we did inform guest services and someone was going to come out but no one ever turned up. Upon entering the villa the smell of damp was over powering that we needed to keep the windows open and spray around the villa, the fridge smelt dreadful.The kitchen looked as like it had not even been cleaned the dishwasher was full of previous guests food all in the bottom of it. The sink had a layer of scum around the edge the bins were filthy and stunk. In one of the twin rooms there was dirty underwear and a sock from previous guests under the dressing table it didn't even look like it had been hoovered all the mirrors in The villa had hand and sticky prints all over them,a lot of the bedding was put on inside out. In the front room there was old stale bread and muck near the patio doors.The toilet looks like it's never seen any bleach and has a yellow staining to it.Neither of the tv remotes worked. The socket in the twin room in between the bed cannot have anything plugged into it's like some one has been very forceful with it in the past. We could not plug the children's game console in due to something being snapped off in the power point in the wall near the tv. The outside light didn't work.We know the cleaner had been in because she left a welcome message on the chalk board.We absolutely love Center Parcs and come every year but I feel the standards are really slipping with the villas. I came away to relax but instead first I had to scrub the fridge dishwasher and sink all of which should really be done before we arrived.It saddens me that I have to write this as all our other breaks have been absolutely fabulous we couldn't fault them and we've been bring our children for nearly 12 years.",1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

groupe_1,"Ok, so we day after new year so it was bound to be busy.  However, as others have commented, the owners seem to have decided on quantity over quality by building far too many rooms, to the point that the rest of the facilities can't cope with the amount of people on the parc.  CAR PARKINGArrived at 2:30 and had to park in the car park as not allowed onto the village with your car till 3pm.  Took a while but managed to find a parking space, helped by the fact that the army of cleaners were just clocking off and moving their cars from the car park (note - they don't have their own staff car park so take up a lot of the spaces).  Eventually got the car to the accommodation and unloaded.  All documents sata that cars are not allowed on the &quot;village&quot; unless loading or unloading or in a designated parking spot for the villa.  When we arrived at the villa (122) there was an off road lay-by for 2 cars so parked in there.  Feeling it was off-road, we left the car overnight only to find a note in the morning stating we were in breach of our &quot;terms and conditions&quot; and to move the car to the car park.  OK, so drove to the car park and then spent 25 minutes trying to find a parking space as there are clearly not enough spaces for the amount of cars/accommodation.  Not helped by the fact that whilst the lay-by's and village are policed for cars, no-one polices the car park and the majority of cars and 4x4's were parked over white lines taking up more than one space.TOP TIP - Don't leave between 2:30 and 3:30.  This is the time the army of cleaners leave the parc and it took us almost 45 minutes to get out of the car park and onto the main road.  Not helped by the 5 double-deck buses parked by the entrance that were then trying to turn round to take staff out of the parc.POOL - The pool is quite small - a lot smaller than the one in Elvenden.  I would suggest that if you came in the summer this wouldn't be so much of an issue but as this was winter and the first afternoon, everyone was in the pool and it was standing room only.  Due to at least 2 &quot;incidents&quot; the main water rides were closed and when the rapids was open, it was left to parents to police the large number of teenagers who had no regard for other people and were pushing and barging their way through.The changing facilities are very small.  Had to queue for 20 minutes just to get a changing room, with many families cramming 4-5 people into one cubicle.  ACCOMMODATION - Facilities in the Villa are great and the room was very clean.  We had an 'updated' room which had new equipment.  Whilst we ate out both nights you could very easily do self-accommodation.  Villa had a large tv (although reception on it was very poor) and comfortable beds with plenty of hanging and storage space.ACTIVITIES - Just be aware that if you go in the winter some activities will be crowded, whilst we found some closed very early.  We wanted to use a pedalo but upon arriving at 2:45 were told they shut at 2:30.  We then couldn't do the golf as it was too crowded.TOP TIP - Book your activities before you go as you never know what will happen.  Fortunately we booked all ours so weren't disappointed.  However, on the final day we heard that the pool had been shut just before 10am and needed to be drained due to another &quot;incident&quot;.  As such, you had a large number of families looking for other things to do!Prices across the park are OK, but having paid a lot for accommodation and the activities you'd have thought some of the others would be cheaper (hence why most use the &quot;free&quot; pool).  The market is well equipped with fresh food items, tins, bread and snacks.  My No.1 recommendation would be the Pottery Painting.  Very helpful and attentive staff and the most relaxing 1.5 hours I've spent in a long time!Overall, we had a a great time.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0

The cleaning wasn't up to the standard of previous years but still OK.The whole site is well decorated with lots of lovely chrismas lights and decorations, really nice to walk around after dark.The pool is great with lots of things for adults and children to enjoy our biggest gripe is it gets very overcrowded at times and we can't help feeling over the years Center Parcs have built more and more accomadation but not inreased the main facilities to allow for the extra guests. It got so bad at times we left the pool as we hated all the ensuing pushing, shoving and over exubarent youths! we also found the life guards to be either totally over the top blowing whistles and telling parents off with small children for basically looking after them to other days when the yobs were allowed to do what they liked!Overall it's a great place to visit especially with young children as they love it, but make sure the bank balance is very heathy as it costs a small fortune!",1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The Santa did an amazing job and they truly believed which we will be forever grateful for.We also have done the cupcake making, stocking decorating and breakfast with Santa which was well worth the money - the singing elves were fantastic. Nothing was rushed, children truly looked after and nothing skimped on..star cookies..Xmas straws..little touches like that are things which we all notice.Oh good presents too!We still have the fireworks to look forward to and another walk through the beautiful lit up woods. Big thanks to the ranger who looks after the reindeer - who took the time out to explain what the reindeer like to eat and how he had been scavenging for hazel leaves this morning.Brilliant arrival with the fake snow, chocolates while queuing to get in and then more gold chocolates too after checking in..Well done center parcs - we've been every year since our children were born but never at this time of year.Thank you.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

groupe_1,"Another wonderful pre-Christmas breakWe had an amazing time this year...always do of course. Lovely interactions with wildlife, swimming, sliding, walking,  cycling, eating out, and snuggling in our very cosy lodge. We had our first Christmas dinner on the Wednesday, watched fireworks on our sun loungers by the lake...it was superb! No traffic on site, so cycling was great fun, especially in the evenings when quiet. We had swans camping outside the patio doors, nesting in fact. It was so funny. We hand fed squirrels, and had an abundance of birds on the feeders we put up. Logs on the fire every evening, it was so lovely. We put heaps of lights up, the lodge looked beautiful. We stayed in the Honeymoon lodge again, but sadly the lovely tree scene wallpaper has been removed and replaced with awful bland and boring plain grey? Just seems madness, but perhaps people don't like colour and interest these days? A new bath has been put in, which was lovely, but no rainfall shower. To shower you have to stand in the bath with a short shower attachment to hose yourself with. LOL Although I have to say we made that a lot of fun! But I miss that wonderful shower with all it's many features. On our arrival our lodge was not ready. I made the bed up when we were unpacking, as I was sure the cleaner wasn't coming back by nearly 15:30. Luckily the clean bedding was on the bed folded ready. A bag was in the entrance hall, which we assumed to be washing to be collected, and we had no towels in the room. We went to customer services and they sent a cleaner to sort towels, but on her arrival she said the bag was clean towels and dressing gowns for the lodge. They just hadn't been put out. On the dining table there were flowers and chocolates, which is always a nice touch. But next to those was a dirty pillow case which I guess must have been used for cleaning and been forgotten with the rest. It was disappointing as we book this lodge for something a little special. Usually the dressing gowns are folded into swans, and everything is so lovely on arrival, but instead it was a bit of a let down. Looks like a good new water slide will be open soon, so we look forward to going on that next visit. The pool and rapids were as fun as ever, we just never get bored of going around those rapids. The back of the park still has some woodland left, so that was fab to walk and cycle round. And still no traffic on site, which does make a big difference. It used to be awful when they encouraged people to drive on and off site all day! The decorations were wonderful, we love the traditional displays. We ate out a few times. On our first day when we went to The Pancake House which was our favourite. I poured pepper on my meal when it arrived, and realised tons of pepper had fallen out. On inspecting the glass pepper pot, it had a big hole in the bottom. (must have previously been dropped on floor) Then on closer look at my meal, loads of tiny shards of glass were on my pancake.  I called the waitress, and she apologised and took my meal away to be replaced. But on the floor there was glass all under our chairs, this too had not been spotted whilst clearing our table before we sat there. I watched my husband eat his meal, then got mine, and he sat there and watched me eat mine...not ideal! Although we had an apology from the waitress, no money was knocked off the bill, at least a free drink could have been offered. We didn't go back there after that. The staff this year were mostly young and didn't look happy in their jobs. Not a very friendly atmosphere this year, one barely looked at you whilst placing food on table. It is a busy restaurant, but usually the staff are wonderful, it's like standards have slipped dramatically there. :-(  Big shame, as the food is lovely, but it felt like a rushed and stressful a place. I am sure if this happened with a family with young children and someone had taken a bite of a meal with glass on it, sorry wouldn't have cut it!Despite our first day of little disappointments, we had a wonderful time, and have booked for next Christmas already, honeymoon lodge again. Just hope things are a bit nicer on arrival next year.We hate to moan about a place we love, but we were a bit miffed about the lodge not being ready, and wish The Pancake House could have seen how terribly serious it is to have glass in a meal. We just thought they would have offered a little something to say sorry, but they didn't seem too concerned.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

Our lodge was spotlessly clean on arrival and was in excellent condition. One slight problem with water pressure in the central heating, affecting just one radiator, was fixed as soon as it was reported. The village was clean and in excellent condition. All of the staff that we met were very friendly and most helpful.The Winter Wonderland display is well worth seeing and we were very impressed by &quot;Santa&quot; when we took our grandson to see him.There are a wide range of activities available both for adults and children, especially for those with an interest in sports. We have no interest in sports but were very happy wandering amongst the trees and enjoying the wildlife - plants as well as animals.In our opinion this is by far the best of the UK Center Parcs. Very close to the Parc is Rufford Abbey Country ParK, which is well worth a visit.For those with children, a visit to The White Post Farm, some 10 minutes drive from the Parc, is recommended.There is also a narrow gauge steam railway nearby, this was not running at Christmas but we believe that it usually runs at weekends.Sherwood Forest Visitor Centre is nearby.

Having said all this I still gave it 4 stars as there are many positives. We try some new activities each year and thoroughly enjoyed laser combat and roller skating. Also did rock climbing and pony rides for the little one. Santa visit was a magical as always and the elves dealt with a special request so well, informing Santa we had moved house to keep the magic alive for our little girl.

groupe_1,"We have just returned from another Center Parcs trip having visited a few times previously and this was our second time at the Winter Wonderland. Wonderful time had by all, we had a large family group ranging in ages and there really is something for everyone. Our lodge was very clean on arrival and all appliances present and working.The children loved the winter wonderland experience-the Parc looked amazing. The fireworks were fantastic although it was a shame the xmas market was missing this year as was the snow globe. The visit to Santa was once again really good, we didn't feel at all rushed and the gift was lovely. We also took part in the indoor climbing and the drop which were great fun and well organised. The swimming was a hit as always and although there were lots of people it didn't feel too overcrowded.We ate at Hucks and the Sports Bar-having not had the best meal in Hucks before we were slightly worried but it was much better food and the service was good. The Sports Bar is fairly simple but the food was fine and it's a great place to head if you haven't booked but decide you fancy eating out.Also a thank you to Simon in the cycle shop who helped us by mending one of our parties broken bikes-this was much appreciated! Overall another lovely experience at Center Parcs-it isn't the cheapest place for food and drink but we have come to expect this and it's great having the lodge and the option to keep costs down by eating in.

groupe_1,"Just returned from our family break at Elveden and we had a fantastic time.  We had a refurbed executive lodge and I think it's worth paying the extra for a refurb.  We were in the pine outer area which was no problem for us as we had bikes, one of which was hired from CP. only took just over 5 minutes to get to central area. We did a few activities, quad bikes (excellent), aerial adventure (my son thoroughly enjoyed, not for faint hearted as very high and has huge zip wire across lake at the end) pony ride (excellent, ladies were very friendly and pony was dressed up xmassy!) aqua jetting and wreath making.  Yes activities are a bit on the pricey side but facilities, equipment and staff are first class.  Could not fault the staff, they were all brilliant.  Pool is excellent, busy but we went first thing or later in day when bit quieter. Don't miss the fireworks they were fantastic and Santa makes an appearance at the end!  We ate out at Cafe Rouge, Bella Italia, Pancake House (try the New Yorker) and Dexter's, all good.  This was our first trip to Elveden, last year we went to Woburn and we much preferred it here.  We can't wait to go back, just wish CP didn't feel the need to increase they're prices SO much during school holidays.  :(",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

The maid cleaned the room on a daily basis.and the lodge had all the required amenities. The establishment itself was great, it was decorated in Christmas lights and decorations. The Santa Workshop was worth spending on, the water park was excellent, the restaurants were varied with fantastic staff. Center Parcs had a wonderful firework display one evening which I believe frequents a couple of times per week. The general cleanliness of the whole facility was superb and we felt very welcome from the start.The only negative was parking up upon arrival, which took at least 30 mins to find a space, however, compared to the whole experience this was very minor and forgotten about once parked up.I would highly recommend Center Parcs Elveden and we will return.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
groupe_1,"I live Center Parcs and this was my second Christmas spent there. It will also be my last - it's definitely worth a winter wonderland visit but I will come when it's a fraction of the price and shops/restaurants are open all the time.Personally, I just don't think it's worth this much money.Bad points: Villa was shabby - they offer updated cabins but should a clean and updated villa not come as standard? My villa - Pine 665 had a broken thermostat casing, a dirty masher, a silver fixture thing that fell off, rusty radiator and filthy carpet. I should pay ¬£100 more for a better one? I don't think so.Cafe Rouge: went twice in one day- day time service impeccable, served by the gentleman with one hand (apologies for using this descriptor, I didn't catch his name) and a blonde lady. Both outstanding. Went again after swimming and got served by a young blonde guy, not rude at all but totally lacked what service is - one drink at the beginning and I was never offered another drink, I ordered my sons desert and when he was given it he asked if I wanted to look at the desert menu.... no thanks pal.Guest Services: Outstanding. A lady called Pat was brilliant however, a young guy (maybe Adam) was fantastic and couldn't do enough to make my son happy including making him a drink, changing the tv so he could watch Disney XD, giving him chocolate buttons and being generally amazing - a credit to the company.Swimming pool: I paid for a photo which I asked to be saved whilst we swam, it was put in the frame upside down and then used as something to lean on as the pic is indented with writing which really annoyed me as it's the only pic I have of us swimming. It's just plain disrespectful. Security: Fantastic and delivered something I'd left to my villa.

groupe_1,We had a great time. We picked the week before Christmas as it is so much cheaper than any other time in the school holidays. This was our second time. We picked the same time last year. We would love to try Center Parcs during the summer or in other school holidays but it is ¬£100's more. The one thing that lets it down is the accommodation. Despite staying in an executive lodge it still felt like it needed updating/looking after. Things had been quickly fixed and not maintained properly. It just looked tired. As a family with two young children who loved every minute of the holiday this was forgotten about but put a dampener on things for me. There were stains all over the bedding and holes in the towels. They loved their activities and swimming. The customer service was fantastic everywhere. The fireworks display was fantastic. The Christmas feel was great. We did miss posting Santa his letters this year. We were looking forward to that element again but it appears they have stopped doing this. The holiday was the perfect type for families. We would like to go again one day. We are thinking of trying others in Europe which seem a lot cheaper.

A member of staff then mentioned they knew there was a problem with that lodge! As we had a 9 month old with chest problems we were disgusted to find out they were still letting the lodge out. The quality of resort also needs updating...dirty floors in swimming pool; tired looking facilities in venue bar; starbucks. Prices for activities and food slso extortionate. It appears centre parcs have got greedy and over priced but let standards slip. Save your money and go to Butlins you'll find the quality of facilities the same!

groupe_1,"We saved a lot of money to pay for our holiday at Center Parcs Elvedon Forest, opting for this break over a flight abroad so we could bring our beloved pet with us.On arrival we soon realised that Center Parcs is really not dog friendly at all. You are not able to take your dog inside with you anywhere to eat or drink, and walking them is impossible off the lead, apart from some very sparse, dingey exercise areas which are ridiculously small and depressing.Considering the size of the park, why not set aside a peice of open grassland etc, just for dog owners so they can allow their dogs off the lead, to throw a ball etc. For such an obviously commercial Park, this is surely very short sighted by the planning and marketing of the operation. We ended up having to walk a long way to our car, and having to drive off the site to nearby woodland just to give our dog a reasonable walk. Not easy with a one year old baby and push chair.having come on here to leave a review, I only wish that I had reviewed Center parcs before booking, as I am not the only disappointed dog owner!!Definitely would not recommend this holiday as dog friendly or as a 'natural' experience, more like walking out of Waitrose having paid 4.50 for a cheese and onion sandwich.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

groupe_1,"This was only a short pre-Christmas break (2nights/3days) but it was a wonderful build up to Christmas. Centre Parcs before Christmas has become a tradition for my family. We have been coming to Centre Parcs for over 16 years and although we also holiday abroad, Centre Parcs is our favourite place. We have stayed in various accommodation in centre parcs, woodland lodge, exclusive and we were even lucky enough to stay in one of the amazing tree houses a few years ago. However, this time we stayed in one of the new exclusive 3 bedroom lodges with a hot tub and sauna. Although the lodge is not as grand as the tree house, the accommodation was wonderful and had everything we needed. Gorgeous decor, en-suites in all bedrooms and the hot tub and sauna were an added bonus. The accommodation was spotless as usual and we were situated close to the country club. There is a small car park close by so we parked our cars there to save us walking  from the large car park. We arrived at 10.00am on Friday 21st December. Although you cannot access your lodge until 3.00pm we wanted to make the most of our stay so we went straight to the subtropical paradise. The rapids are one of our favourite things about centre parcs and one of the reasons we keep returning so we headed straight for those. Once we were able to access our lodge we stayed in and made the most of our lovely accommodation with the sauna and hot tub. On the Saturday we had a lazy morning, we love waking up to see the ducks and squirrels on our patio. My youngest daughter bought some food for them from the nature shop and enjoyed feeding them. In the afternoon we went for a nice walk and called at the country club for drinks. Then we walked down to the beach to watch the spectacular firework display. There was a lovely atmosphere with lots of Christmas music and the fireworks were amazing. On Sunday, we had to be out of our lodge for 10.00 but we planned on staying in centre parcs all day to make the most of our stay. The only negative thing about our stay was finding a parking space on the day of our departure. It took my husband over 30 mins to find a space and it took my mum almost 1 and a half hours! She was feeling quite stressed. After finally managing to park we headed of to see Santa and his reindeer. We have done this every year but I think unfortunately this may be the last one because our youngest daughter is now 8. Visiting Santa is very magical as are all the decorations around centre parcs. Again one of the reasons why we go to centre parcs before Christmas. After visiting Santa we went to the sports bar for some lunch, it was very busy and we struggled to find a table but when we did the food was lovely as usual. After lunch, I had booked geocaching which we had never done before. Infact I was unsure of what it was. It's a bit like a treasure hunt with gps. The weather wasn't very good but we had lots of fun doing the geocache. We were wet through and it took almost 2 hours to complete but we really enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it to people who enjoy walking. My mum and oldest daughter didn't take part as they don't. To top it off we actually won, we won a game of bowling for the whole family. After bowling, we went swimming again (5.30 till 8.30) but this time we booked a cabana. These are amazing, we booked one the previous year and would definitely book again. As it was evening, subtropical paradise was a lot quieter and very relaxing. We love swimming in the outdoor pool and going on the rapids in the dark. My mum enjoyed relaxing in the cabana, watching tv while we went on the rapids and rides as much as we could. Finally, we had a meal booked in the Indian restaurant at 9.00pm. This is our favourite restaurant at centre parcs and we had the set menus which includes a drink. It's very good value and definitely the best Indian we have ever had. Then, sadly we had to leave but luckily with some more magical memories. We would love to book again for next year but we are considering whether we should come for Christmas or new year.

We stayed in a 2 bedroom woodland lodge and were extremely impressed with the decor and the high standard of cleanliness. The blackboard with messages from the cleaning staff was a lovely touch and my children enjoyed writing messages back to them. Attention to detail was extremely high and we had no problem with ovens/dishwashers/toilets etc that other posters have commented on.Activities- we are quite a wide ranging in age family with children of 14, 8 and 3 months. There was something for all of them, oldest loved quad biking with his Dad, middle enjoyed Robin Hood archery and the youngest enjoyed baby sensory. We took advantage of the cr√®che facilities with the youngest to allow us to spend time with the oldest two and I was extremely impressed, it was as good as a private daycare provider and the activities the staff did with him were really lovely. We all had fun in the swimming pool (bar an opinionated middle aged hag who had her own opinions on a baby being in the water but hardly CP's fault).Why not 5 stars? We were let down badly by appalling customer service in Hicks-1 hour wait for a starter and 2 and a half hours overall is terrible. The food was not of a good quality (our stomachs are testimony to that today) and I feel slightly put out at having to pay ¬£2.65 for a second drink when the service was as slow as it was (incidentally I'm a Breastfeeding mother so hydration is really important). The ground around the holes in footgolf was worn away in places which meant the ball could not get into the hole.

I was looking forward to immersing myself in nature and it was lovely seeing the muntjac deer, squirrels and birds out of the windows. However I was disappointed with fireworks going off (this apparently happens twice a week) it was incredibly loud, I did feel sorry for the poor deer and other animals who get scared to death twice a week with the loud fireworks noise. This I thought was quite short sighted of Centre Parcs, they need to give more consideration to their surrounding wildlife. Centre Parcs do recycle and there are recycle bins, however it would have been nice to have seen more of an environmentally friendly approach e.g. no disposable coffee cups and plastic straws. Maybe sell local produce or locally made items. On a positive there is enough there, certainly for kids, the swimming pool was good and the Aqua Sauna was fantastic - modern, immaculate with great customer service.

The lodge - we did not pay for a newly decorated lodge so expected some wear. The lodge was really nice. The location was fantastic, we could walk into the main centre within 5 minutes and we had perfect views of the fireworks on the Wednesday evening. The twin room was cosy but had enough room for our daughter. The double room was large and had ample space for a cot should someone need it. The winter wonderland experience was great. All the lights after dark were beautiful and our little one loved them. At only 2, our daughter was limited for things to do but she did go on an Elf Hunt, a visit to Santa and toddler football. She enjoyed them all. The swimming pool is lovely. It has plenty of different areas and even when busy it doesn't feel too cramped for space. The downsides - the Parc Market is very expensive. Next time we will bring food with us. Some of the staff are also a little glum. Ordinarily you might not notice that but when all the other staff throughout Centre Parcs are so friendly, the miserable ones stick out like a sore thumb. The swimming pool could definitely open earlier. It's not a major issue but we would have loved to go swimming at 8 or 9 but had to wait until 10am - at this point my toddler was starting to get tired and grumpy.To conclude, this is a great place to visit. It is better suited to families with children over 3 - there were very few activities for my 2 year old.

We had a lodge very close to the village square where the road is built for single one way traffic. So unpacking your car is a struggle.

Everything was grubby, I can be fussy but even my partner noticed it. We had put on the website my 2 month old was coming so I presumed there would be a cot in there already, there wasn't, so make sure you request one. I phoned and it arrived with a mattress with no sheet or anything on. So make sure you ask or you bring your own. Luckily my baby sleeps in something else as well as a cot. There is not enough space in the one bedroom lodges for a cot. Luckily I am quite small so I managed to put the cot down one side of the bed and managed to jump over my partner. The next morning we complained about the dirty lodge and they sent people over to clean it which they did and I must say if they had cleaned it like they did the second time I wouldn't be writing a review!

groupe_2,"I am late in submitting this review due to a busy few weeks after our visit. But we visited Sherwood on 2nd November to 5th November 2018 for Bonfire weekend. It was our first ever visit to Sherwood having previously visited Whinfell a couple of times. We stayed in 407 Birch Area in a 3-bedroom lodge - me, my husband, 2 children aged 6 and 3 and our family friend. LODGE: Superb. It was in a very quiet area of the park, slightly set back from the road and we had a brilliant area at the back where previous guests had used it to ride their bikes etc as a ready made 'BMX track' had been embedded into the earth. We usually stay in the executive lodges and last year we had a games room at Whinfell but this year felt the 'bog standard woodland lodge' would suffice. And it did! In fact I would say unless you intend to spend a lot of time in your lodge, don't bother with the executive lodges with the saunas and games room. We were rarely in our lodge except to eat and sleep. It had everything we needed BUT do stock up on toilet paper as you do not get maid service. But even so, it's woodland lodges all the way from now on! GROUNDS:Extensive, mostly flat (great for cycling) but not as flat as I thought. Whinfell has a lot of gradients but in all honesty, I didn't find Sherwood that much easier to cycle around (it may be me being unfit!). I found the road system confusing but this could be because it's a really big site! We often cycled in circles! But the grounds are well signposted, maintained and very safe. By Sunday I was the only one in the group who had mastered the navigation! ACTIVITIES:Loads! We only did bowling which I would recommend and book and our two children did the jet-ski. My 6, nearly 7 year old had done this before and is a confident, strong swimmer and found it incredibly tame in the 50cm of water but my 3 year old found it exciting as it was her first time. We hired bikes and found the staff were incredibly friendly, helpful and of good humour. If you can, bring your own bike but CP bikes are maintained to a very high standard and easy to use. SWIMMING:We enjoy swimming a lot and here is where we spent most of our time. They are extending the facilities here and unless you go into the outside pool where you can very obviously see the new slide, you don't know it! I found the swimming area dark due to the wood supports and decor. Whinfell is white and bright and has the feeling of spaciousness. Sherwood does not. Besides this, we found the facilities enjoyable notably the rapids which my 6 year old spent most of his time on. I felt ill on my first visit due to heat and busyness. Avoid Friday morning/afternoon swimming! The children's facilities were a bit 'meh' but this is to be improved next year with the new children's splash area. The wave machine wasn't as good as Whinfell BUT the multi-person slide was good and our 3 year old was allowed on. A long time to queue (25 minutes at most) so would advise using after 6pm or queue before it opens. There are 2 other slides too; the shorter one isn't great as I nearly stopped but the longer one up the steps is quite brutal! There is a cafe inside so if you are big fans, you need not leave all day! We managed 2 hours each time due to a 3 year old! PUBS &amp; RESTAURANTS (SHOPS TOO!):We went to the Country Club and liked it here. It was out of the way of the village centre and has a lovely children's play area. Our kids loved it here. We just had a drink but meals are provided. We ate at Hucks on Friday afternoon and LOVED it there/ The staff are amazing, kids ate buffet style which meant they eat straight away (food was GOOD!) and when ours arrived, they went to the play area so we ate in peace! We also ate at the Pancake House. Not great value, food okay but the chocoholic stacked pancakes does not come with enough chocolate. For the name I expect it to be dripping in chocolate but instead the pancakes became dry with two more to go! I think we were unlucky but our waitress was a bit miserable and the place was busy, loud and cramped. We wouldn't go again in a hurry. BONFIRE NIGHT:They put on light entertainment and a few food tents but the firework display was a bit 'meh'. Whinfell is MUCH better. Plus they advise everyone to use the beach which was 20-30 deep and so we lost a lot of the view and atmosphere. Whinfell may not provide the music and carnival style entertainment and tents, but their viewing area is more expanse and the fireworks were better. PLAYAREA:Good playareas but we didn't use these as much as we did at Whinfell mainly because of our schedule but they seemed to be just as good as Whinfell and slightly more of them if my memory serves me correct. LOCATION: Just an hour and 20 minutes from our home, it was ideal. But the location didn't seem to have that country, isolated, in the middle of nowhere feeling like Whinfell. We turned right at the traffic lights and about 200 metres later turned left and we were there. Whinfell is near the Lakes, turning off a main A road but in the middle of nowhere with a lovely country, woodland road far into the forest. WOULD WE RETURN?Probably! I couldn't fault the place (except for one thing below!) and nothing disappointed us. But for us Whinfell meets our desires better and its a lot cheaper too! We would return to Sherwood if asked, if the price was right etc. The new slide attracts us BUT we know there will be crazy queues so puts us off having the desire to go really. We haven't booked for next year and not sure we will as we like to try other places but we will be back!TIPS/HINTS/IMPROVEMENTS:Outside 407 Birch Area there is a small ditch either side of the road. In the dusk and dark this is VERY dangerous for cyclists as we found out. It's very poor lighting and our 6 year old rode his bike into the ditch and we thought he had broken his leg! Even fluorescent paint, warning signs etc to help reduce the likelihood of accidents.Swimming in the evening is MUCH quieter. Hardly any queues to the slide attractions and we went without our 3 year old which meant we didn't need to do parent swaps. Pancake House is not what you think (at least for us!). More chocolate on your CHOCOHOLIC PANCAKE STACK!Get a bike or take one. You get to places quicker and can therefore do more stuff!Friday afternoon - book a table at Hucks after your arrival swim. Lovely staff, great atmosphere (BUT expensive - ¬£90 for 5 meals - 2 of them kids meals - and 6 drinks). When eating in, bring food with you. The supermarket is not supermarket prices - unless you shop at Waitrose! Book a bowling slot one afternoon.When you want to go to the country club, take the path to the LEFT of Hucks as you look at the lake. Not right. I had to wait 10 minutes for the other part of my group because we were in disagreement about the quickest route. I won!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

However, the other facilities (swimming, food, activities) were excellent and the staff we interacted with (e.g. kids football, treetop totts, mini captains adventure) were all really friendly.Hucks, we'd probably avoid next time in favour of Bella Italia or cafe rouge which were much nicer.

The Parc was set up for Christmas with lovely lighting and numerous Santa themed areas for the children. The accommodation is good. We chose to stay on the outskirts of the Parc away from the centre which was quiet. The lodge was just right and was warm, clean, well maintained and had everything you needed. However the RAF next door will provide an early morning call, so be warned. We found the centre to have numerous shops selling good quality stuff - not cheap however. The Parc supermarket was very well stocked fair to say a little more expensive that your usual supermarket. We look our own bikes however there was a large range of bikes for hire for everyone. There are many activities you can do throughout the Parc - at a price. We did the spa 3 hr which I can recommend. The pool was good however more a fun pool and not for proper swimming. So pointers - if you are on a budget advise taking your food and drinks with you - just using the Parc market for the likes of milk. If you are going during the winter period take the logs for the fire with you. We brought ours from Asda and will save you money rather than buy at the Parc market. It was lovely to have a fire going and made the lodge feel cosy. Remember where you left your bikes especially at night. We lost ours twice and spent at while finding them again.

groupe_2,"I've been coming to Center Parcs since it first opened, at least once a year and during term time for 4 nights - in the past my parents alternated between Sherwood and Elveden each year, and in adulthood, i've mainly stuck with Elveden for my own family now (i prefer the layout and the swimming, even though it's a 4/5 hour a drive as opposed to 2 hours to Sherwood). I'm not a fan of the weekend breaks because it struggles to be good value for money but anyway, we came to Sherwood for an extra trip to our usual annual jaunt this year, to celebrate my Dad's 70th Birthday as a big family group for the first time.  And sadly it does reaffirm my preference of Elveden. There's just a bit less charm to Sherwood really. The subtropical swimming 'paradise' is significantly outdated (although, they are refurbing, but i just can't see how it could be refurbed to the other sites standard with the size and layout here), the changing rooms are grubby and hectic - no shower cubicles if you desire privacy for your family. Resulting in my partner getting publically shamed for my autistic 5 year old messing about with his towel after showering and unintentionally (and not particualrly severely!) flashing his backside - a brash Scottish woman who spent the day stood at the showers like a Bouncer thought it neccessary to loudly exclaim that there's signs everywhere saying showering should be done clothed (yes, i know thanks, and yes, he was showered in his shorts, thanks) and then shaming him further by telling him hes too old to be seen naked by anyone, especially with &quot;the news nowadays&quot; (eh?) Rude, insulting, patronising, over-reactionary and totally uncalled for IMO. Also encountered another episode of rudeness within the swimmming dome, when my whole family were sat on loungers close (as in, within about 10 metres) to the training pool, and my 10yo and 5yo were paddling safely with no-one else in the pool - the lifeguard on duty in there came over and snappily told us one of us should be next to the pool watching our kids. We were, there was 6 adults within eyeline of the pool, my 10yo is an exceptional swimmer and was next to my 5yo who can swim competently, although isn't expert-level at the recognicable strokes yet, but he's more than capable of being in a pool without an adult next to him in the water. I went and sat on a chair literally next to the pool as requested anyway. Then my partner overhears this guy telling another lifeguard that we're neglectful and just left our kids in the pool on their own! Cheers pal.And the villa - it's ok, they always are. But there's always something petty and annoying isn't there. Zero ice cube trays for example, a grill tray literally swimming in dried on grease, huge lack of utensils, 1/5 of a loo roll in each loo etc. I politely tweeted if anyone could possibly drop us an ice cube tray off at some point - never happened  (whereas at Elveden in January, we had no chopping board and a smiley lady was at the door with one within 5 mins of my tweet). I thought we might have had a little note on the chalkboard recognising my Dad's 70th birthday too (seeing as you have to detail every fine detail about yourself before check-in), but no, nothing.Oh and, the car park is ridiculous too.Saying all that though... we had a lovely time overall, the Santa was the coolest we've ever encountered and was brill with the 10yo non-believer who wasn't a paid participant to the Grotto experience, but tagged along in the background - we ended up with him being invited into the photo and Santa did a dab which raised a smile from his normally unimpressed self! The fireworks were great, a meal at Cafe Rouge was just about ok (very slow, but the waiting staff were lovely), the group photo session was amazing (but i am appalled at the print prices tbh, and i'm getting anxious about how we're going to afford to purchase any), and everyone who used the spa and beauty services were very impressed.

groupe_2,"This was the first time we have stayed at Elvedon. Our lodge was nestled in the trees by the lake, a lovely setting especially with the beautiful autumn leaves. Our lodge was very clean, warm and comfortable and well equipped. The grounds are well kept with well lit paths through the forest, and lots of signage. However we still managed to get lost a few times, adding to the fun and discovering parts we had not seen before! Great sense of freedom with no cars to worry about, although we did not have our grandchildren with us the forest would be a great place for them to explore and I would suggest bringing or hiring bikes for them. Being ladies of a mature age we did not take part in any activities but had a wonderful day at the Aqua Sana Spa with a very good massage and facial. The pool complex and flumes were fun although a separate pool just for swimming would have been a bonus. We did not eat at any of the restaurants, preferring to eat in, but the shop was very well stocked with provisions. Overall a very enjoyable stay in a beautiful setting with the bonus of the Christmas lights being put up while we were there in readiness for the Winter Wonderland which made it all very magical.

The food came quickly but despite asking for the table to be cleared it remained the same the whole 75 minutes we sat there! Very slow service in getting served and having tables cleared. The same thing happened at Starbucks coffee shop at reception  area, it took ages to get served and yet again no-one came to clear the table the whole time we sat there.On a positive  note the bar upstairs was good, till service good and table clearing swift. Secondly after a swimming session we wanted to shower but ALL of the shower gel dispensers were empty and a lot of people were complaining about this.

groupe_2,"We've been bring the children to Centre Parcs for the past 4 years as the surroundings and activities are great. This year we took a basic two bedroom woodland lodge which unfortunately is really really outdated and in need of a refresh.Every time we cooked, the fire alarm went off and we heard other fire alarms from other lodges too. The curtain rail fell down just as we pulled the curtains. Bathrooms were clean, but the shower was very poor. Bedrooms were nice, but one of the bedsheets had a rip (minor issue, but not what I would expect).On the plus side, it's great to wake up with all the squirrels, ducks, geese and dear. We all love to see the wildlife. The swimming pool is always a big hit, but I found the supposedly subtropical temperatures a bit too cold.The activities available (best to pre-book if you go during half term) where all good, but some quite over priced in my opinion. Because it was half term and we hadn't pre-booked, the children were disappointed that they couldn't do everything they wanted.We only ate out twice, once at the Pancake House and once at Bella Italia. The Pancake House was great, but very pricey for pancakes and waffles. Unfortunately our experience at Bella Italia was not great at all :-(. It took forever for our food to arrive and only arrive after I asked the waiter what was going on (especially as the restaurant was quiet) and when it did turn up the portion sizes were not good. We were given a discount on the bill. The Parcmarket is convenient, but with this comes hiked up prices. Best advice is plan before you go otherwise you pay the price.

I did struggle to get a sense of places due to the forest environment and kept getting lost, but everyone else seemed fine!  The lodge was just right for a family of 4 and it was identical to the ones at Sherwood Forest. Also, it was warm and cosy, we never used the fire.Really fun activities, especially the indoor climbing and junior quad bikes. I should say the instructors on the quad bikes were brilliant and our kids enjoyed this activity the most. Swimming pool was good- warm and clean - and the ride (cyclone?) was amazing fun - our kids are 6 &amp; 7 and tall enough to go on.The firework night was a great surprise and we followed this with dinner at Bella pasta which was very good. The food and service in the sports bar was also good.We paid around ¬£600 which I thought was good value for money in school holidays.

Xmas decorations were wonderful.Only complaint for the whole stay is that we went with our 11 month old daughter. There are limited things for a baby except for the pool and soft play areas. We went to the soft play in the sport de Jardine and in the coffee house. One was for under 5's and the other under 3's. Yet every time our baby was mown down by kids up to about 9! Not once whilst we were there did any staff come over and check. I admit that selfish parents watching their clearly older kids playing in a baby play area is the problem here but in the absence of good parents, I think it would have been good for park staff to monitor these areas for this issue as I was not the only parent finding this a problem. In the park de Jardine there was a play area just the same for the older kids right next to the baby one too so this infuriates me that the babies couldn't even have there own safe space in this one little area :(",1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0

groupe_2,"This is our fourth visit (fifth if you count a day visit to last years winter wonderland) and this one was by a long shot the worst of them all, probably to the point that I think I've seen Center Parcs for what it is; a shameless cash cow.Swimming Pool:We usually go at least twice per stay, this time it was just the once. Changing facilities are a nightmare at the best of times but this time it was just insane, queues at every door with people just wanting to get changed and get out of there. Not enough room for those going in to even get past the people waiting to get out. We didn't bother trying it again. The kids pool has gone from tolerable to rubbish with the removal of the bigger slide in the kids area, resulting in one bored five year old. With all the new houses being built there's an urgent need to increase capacity on the things that people don't &quot;pay&quot; for. Lockers are the other thing, this place really needs the keyless stuff they have in Whinfell. Activities:Generally good, our littlest one went to the Balance bikes which was ok, our oldest went to the Crazy Science session with me, which was good fun and credit goes to Rob for keeping the attention of the group throughout the hour. Winter Wonderland was nice, but again, too many people for the space given. We had booked two slots for a Santa visit, and both kids saw him together, yet still we felt like the entire experienced was rushed. Four attempts at a photo, none of which were perfect and given gifts and sent on our way. Great memories for us and the kids...or not. The festive carriage ride was nice. Cannot remember the lady's name (horse was called Troy) but very polite and welcoming. At the best part of ¬£40 however it is grossly overpriced for 15 minutes.Food:The first night we ordered take out from the on-site takeaway. Generally nice but can't understand why the rice ordered with the curry was covered in some spicy tomato goop. Couldn't combine the two as you usually would. The next night we went to Hucks. Its been a couple of years and the place has been done up since the last visit. The play area is a step backwards, the place generally seems to have an issue with ball pits all of a sudden.Accommodation:We were in the Birch area, third time out of four. Quiet enough and easy to get to from the main facilities (except the Foresters Inn, which is completely the other end of the site). This was an executive 2 bed, which was tiny for ¬£800 to be entirely honest, if it was four adults in here it would be claustrophobic. Boiler defaulted to 23 degrees, which I believe is around the temperature of hell, especially when combined with the very heavy duvet covers provided, not nice to wake up to in the middle of the night. The next morning said boiler decided to not heat the water, so managed to sample the artic as well!General:The main gripe is the little things. You used to get a nice full bowl of chalk to draw on the board with (or the kids). Now you get stubby bits....but you can buy some in the shop! Pretty much the same with everything else, if it doesn't make money its not seemingly worth investing in.

The waitress said 'yes please don't worry hey're free and won't be on your bill'. We said to each other afterwrads just keep an eye on the final bill as this sounded to good to be true.So we finished our meal and guess what on the recipt we were indeed charged for Fries. We told our waitress who thensaid to us no word of a lie 'Well there not free and you weren't old they were free! I'll take them off but I won't do this again next time'. I was so shocked she'd call us liars and she seemed now to be the xpert and a witness of supposedly everything that had happened.This was disgusting customer service from the Waitress and for the rest of our stay I refused to visit the place again as the whole experience left me feeling bitter and very angry.,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,0.0,

groupe_2,"This was our second time visiting Center Parcs, last year there were 7 of us who visited during the kids half term in October, needless to say it was quite an expensive time of year to come and we spent a lot of money on the lodge we were in. Needless to say, the lady that came every day to tidy up after us all was absolutely marvellous and she even made the time to make towel animals with the kids. The whole experience was fantastic! This year we decided to come on our own as a family and as we only have a little boy who is 2 we decided to take advantage of skipping the whole school holidays and save ourselves a few pennies. Unfortunately, we didn't get the same experience. Although we only spent ¬£300 we didn't receive the nice little welcome note on the chalk board that we did the first year, plus we only had white chalk, unlike the year before when we had coloured chalk. Our sheets were covered in what can only be described as snot. The plug hole in the bath was full of hair and gunk which we had to clean out due to water not draining.Although all of these things on there own are no big drama, as a collective it just felt like we had paid less money and had less of a service and less care was given to ensuring the lodge was nice and clean.Either way we still had a lovely time while we were there and our 2 year old thoroughly enjoyed himself and we may possibly be back next year.",1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0

It was all very nice and you could see a great deal of thought had gone into the furnishings. The only thing I would fault was that there seemed to have been an effort made to make everything special sometimes at the expense of practicality- one example being an iPad to operate the AV system. We would have much rather had a remote control! The host and all staff we met were all lovely- even the maintenance staff....the pool area was very busy on the Saturday and as commented on many times the changing rooms desperately need modernising- I gather they are being sorted out as part of the modernisation currently in progress.

Waterside apartments are minutes from the central village too so would recommend over the Breckland apartments unless you want seclusion. The ground floor waterside apartments have no fencing and you can walk out of the back door onto the grass and paths behind the apartments so if you like to stroll out to the lake great but if you prefer piece of mind incase you forget to lock the door would reccomend 1st floor and above which you can choose via the map of the building.

The last two visits Sherwood  and Elveden in a woodland lodge have been disappointing to say the least.  I refuse to pay for a refurbished room because we spend most of the day out and the holiday is costly enough. So everyone who visits has a right to clean comfortable accommodation - two of the duvet covers were stained the carpets were dirty and there was a fag packet empty in the sofa.  The lodge was tatty looking very tired and worn.   All just very grim.  I did complain to the management last  year when a blind fell and hit me on the head but we should not have to and certainly don't want to!

We stayed in the woodland lodge type and it was much smaller then Whinfell and the outside was looking bit old ugly and cheap looking but the inside was fine. The winter wonderland part was ok the quality was not as good as whinfell and the father Christmas part just looked like a poor ugly shed with Christmas lights on. There is no paths to walk we had to walk in the road and a few times nearly fell down a ditch as there are ditches at the side on the road with it been so dark and cars where still driving around we had to keep walking to the side. The road it not safe people where not following the one way and massive cars took up most of the road so it was hard to drive without going down the ditches you have at the side of the road theses need filling in so people can walk safely to the side. We enjoyed the swimming pool it is smaller then Whinfell but loved going at night it was not as busy. The supermarket and other shops are great and restaurant are about average.

The team at Centre Parts Sherwood Forest put on a beautiful show of fireworks 2 times in the week of November which have had us hooked and wanting to return. On the evening of the firework display they have stalls set up with alcoholic and soft drinks, baked potatoes, burgers, hot dogs and roast pork sandwiches from a hog roast.Over the past five years we have been in different accommodation from the woodland lodges to executive lodges and both are beautifully furnished and all the modern amenities you have at home with a stocked kitchen to cook your own meals, nicely set out living room with tv and DVD player and nice cosy bedroom to get your head down.Moving from the accommodation there is soooo much to do for any age group while in town. Firstly swimming is 100% free for all and is a great way to pass some time. There is bowling, tennis, badmington, snooker, pool, gym, adventure golf, pedalos and electric boats to take on the lake but to name a few. Truly are about 100 things to go and do while here. Although as stated earlier there is a perfectly stocked kitchen to cook from there is so many more things with regards to food on offer while here. There is an Indian called Rajinda Pradesh, Bella Italia, Cafe Rough (simple French inspired cuisine) dexters diner (burgers &amp; fries with shakes) Hucks Diner (American diner) and the Foresters Inn which offers a more upmarket menu by the looks though I haven't personally sampled this one. Simply put there is a joy to visit, the staff are so attentive and can't do enough for you and the level of entertainment on offer is fantastic couple that with how close you to nature with all manor of birds, ducks, geese and swans the beautiful lakes and trees all around create a beautiful setting.

groupe_2,"Just got back from a midweek break at Center Parcs Sherwood Forest. Enjoyed it a lot and had a relaxing time there. In particular the housekeeping staff were very friendly, the staff accross the whole park were. It is expensive but we knew that already before going. Our accomodation was lovely (3 bedroom new exec lodge) and I really enjoyed the holiday. The only negatives:- the signs around the park. i'm sure it's a case of getting used to it but I feel like they could be more signs and in bigger text with more light as at night time (which is about 4.30pm in winter) you can't hardly see them to read where you are meant to be going.- the multi media systems in lodges. Ours was billed as having an interactive multi media system but when you get there you can't connect your phones to the TV pretty much if you have an iphone. I understand a lot of people will say 'you arent on holiday to watch tv!' but it would have been nice on a night to watch Netflix or similar.- the spa. I LOVE the Aqua Sana spa, at both Center Parcs locations that I have been to, but unfortunately I felt let down on this visit. I had booked a spa session twice during the times we were there, Tues and Thurs. Tuesday was ok but Thursday (6pm-9pm) was absolutely overrun with people which resulted in all of the rooms being full pretty much all of the time, including the pool, and meant you only got to use 1 or 2 rooms. When you are paying ¬£69+ for the privilege, thats bad. I really think Aqua Sana should consider a lower limit on the amount of people they admit per session. I dont suppose they will because they want to pack as many people in to get more money, but it was too busy to 'relax' due to the high numbers of people in there.Aside from those little things, I had a great holiday and would return to Center Parcs.",1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

groupe_2,"First time family visit to Sherwood (but not to Center Parcs sites in UK).An important starting point is that any CP site is not a cheap holiday venue and in school holiday weeks they are expensive venues but as the Government cannot control the holidays market, you like it or lump it (but should complain if poor service is experienced). It is possible to check the prices of activities before committing to a holiday and as it is best to book activities - even for outside term time - visitors should be able to budget for costs (incl. eating in the restaurants - which appear marginally more expensive than their High St. equivalents). What is annoying is that regular, registered customers cannot use offers - e.g. at Bella Italia.Late Monday morning check in (with 2 cars) was speedy - so we headed for a snack lunch before exploring. We used Dexter's Kitchen and were slightly surprised when advised of the cooking time - as it is not a huge unit. However, we did not have to wait the full time and the Caesar Salad was large - so the price justified. Apparently the kitchen also serves the cafe in the swimming pool area - that's why service can  take a while.We had viewed our villa (meeting our cleaner, Sarah, in the process), before moving the cars up to unload. Everywhere was spotless and in good condition. We had enough storage space for 5 days, so not sure what people who don't have enough space bring for an informal holiday.Due to improvementmaintenance work; we had been switched from the original choice of accommodation but this had been discussed and was amicably done. We could understand why some people very near to the work may not have been happy with the 7.30 - 8.00 start (not everyone sensibly checks the website for up-dates).We had (with eyes open as to prices) booked various activities for our grand-daughter and especially as we were lucky with the weather, she had a great time. Highlights were the falconry (very well done by Zac),  'mermaiding', wildlife walk and willow weaving but she also enjoyed the adventure golf, archery (that much more than at another venue earlier in the year) pottery painting and general swimming. Special thanks to Martin of the Nature Centre staff - who was brilliant both on the wildlife walk and with the willow weaving. Prices at the mini-market seemed to be a mixture of quite reasonable and expensive. My daughter enjoyed the spa but I don't know more than that.We were visiting at the time of the Christmas decorations (which were nice) and the fireworks display - really enjoying watching the latter.  We did not rush to leave after breakfast on the Friday but the four days went all too quickly. Unlike other CP sites visited, no real problems finding car park spaces when needed on Day 1 and Day 5. Sensibly there is overflow parking. For people coming on site after dusk or driving, in the winter, to accommodation, the signage could be clearer - as, on the larger signs, dark green background and lettering that does not stand out is not ideal and the signpost type signs, to accommodation, have small lettering that, although light coloured, is well above head height (so not readily picked up by dipped headlights). All contacts we had with CP staff were friendly and effective - with none involving complaints.As always, the crucial question is would we go back? The answer maybe - as have already established that 2019 half-term prices for the ideal accommodation are beyond daughter's budget (so creative thinking needed).",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,

She took all the details and came back with all the packaging and photographs of packets for our use, sadly he wasn't able to have what he wanted, but with some help from Amy and some tweaking of the cheese burger one little boy didn't feel left out. We were amazed that all his cutlery turned up sterilised and wrapped in cling film. The service was outstanding.

The lodge was top quality and clean, warm. Really nice place to stay. The beds were very comfortable and we slept well, although the baby cot was a bit flimsy. The car park was too far from the lodge and it took my partner an hour to walk back as it was also hard to find directions. We travelled with 3 kids 13, 5 and 1. We went to the pool on the first day and we spent all day in there, we all had a great time. The water and air temp was warm so the baby did not get cold. When looking through the activities, we was reluctant to pay the very expensive prices. We did do bowling which was 30 for 60 min. We managed 1 and a half games and then it cut off so, not great. There are some great little free adventure playgrounds scattered around which we all enjoyed. 5 year old went to see Santa ¬£15. The whole xmas set up is really impressive and magical, with lights, reindeers, music, pony, horse and carriage rides, but again was expensive. Would of cost us 50 quid nearly just for a 15 min ride!!! No way. We spent our last evening in Hucks restaurant. Food was great and staff were friendly. If you eat there then you get to use there viewing platform to view the fireworks. The fireworks were great and Santa came up and down the lake to wave at all the kids, which was very cute.

groupe_2,"Where do I start, I visited elveden forest and sherwood center parcs many years ago and found both stays to be of exceptional quality . Unfortunately a recent visit to Sherwood Forest center parcs was exactly the opposite.We booked a weekend at the beginning of October half term as a treat for the children. The cost for four of us to stay in an executive villa was ¬£749 for three nights. In my view ridiculously overpriced for the experience that awaited us.  Check in was chaos, the roads entering the village are narrow and traffic was gridlocked in both directions. Our villa was situated far at the other side of the facility and we found it difficult to locate the alternative car park closest to our villa, the roads through the village are again very narrow with drainage ditches and large boulders on either side , parking outside the villas for loading and unloading luggage were inadequate.We decided to enter the park at 10am as our information pack said we could. And walked into the main village square to use the swimming pool and u201c subtropical domeu201d , what we were greeted by was tired looking dirty changing facilities, lots of rust on the metal fitments, inadequate shower and toilet facilities for the volume of guests using the pool. The pool itself was cold , packed with people so badly we were crammed in shoulder to shoulder and the environment looked like it was seriously in need of an upgrade. The wooden ceiling is peeling and shabby looking and the hot spa pools were not even warm . Everyone was complaining about being cold.Our villa was pleasant enough but the televisions were tiny and poor quality with very limited channels. It was nice to have a spa bath but the shower in the children's room was not working and spewed water out of the pipe when turned on. Let's talk about prices ... we checked out the burger bar next to the pool .. a burger meal, drink and chips was priced at just a few pence shy of ¬£15 each .. costing around ¬£60 for a family of four we were horrified. Everything within the park is extremely overpriced and mostly made up of chain restaurants such as Starbucks and Bella Italia. The main areas were ridiculously busy and people there seemed to be very rude. There was a lot of pushing and shoving . Our villa cleaner however was excellent, polite, thorough and efficient. Check out day was absolute hell!! The lack of a fit for purpose road system , rude entitled people in suv 's and the terrible lack of parking left a real downer on our break. I would say it is actually dangerous. A man in a big 4x4 nearly ran my daughter over in his haste to get by us loading our car. The highlight of our stay was a owl encounter experience which we all thoroughly enjoyed, the man who did this interactive presentation cannot be praised enough for his patience and presentation skills. We opted to spend the last day swimming just to avoid the dangerous situation with the roads leaving the park. We will not be returning and I would not recommend this place. Overpriced, needs a huge refurb , too many people packed in and dangerous road systems. All I expect from this review is a generic corporate u201c sorry you had this experience we are planning improvements u201c schpiel .

We are a family with 3 kids, 2 older teens and a 9 year old so struggle to find something for everyone. We found Center Parcs ticked all of the boxes for us. I will try to break down my review for easy reading. AccommodationWe stayed in a 3 bed new style executive villa. Number 136. The villa was stunning and exceeded our expectations. The villa was very clean and had everything we needed for our stay. We had toiletries, toilet roll and tassimo pods provided as well as a few dishwasher tablets. We cooked all our own meals and took our slow cooker for ease so we could have a hot meal waiting for when we returned and we found this worked well. We had a sauna included which we didn't use and a spa bath which unfortunately didn't work but this didn't spoil our stay. ResortWe found the pool fantastic. We liked how it was open until 9pm at night so we could relax in there for as long as we wanted. At times we found the water temperature a bit cool though and the hot tubs could have been hotter. The rapids are ace, really enjoyed them. We did a few activities on resort that we pre booked. My daughter did the high ropes challenge, the zip wire and  leap of faith. My son did paintball and scuba. My younger daughter did snorkelling and pottery painting. We all did bowling and we hired bikes. We found the activities very good value for money and whilst slightly more expensive than Butlins they lasted longer and were better quality. We didn't eat out on resort choosing instead to self cater but we did check out the menu prices and found the food to be pricey. We visited the Parc market a number of times for snacks and found this to be not too expensive. The resort we found to be lovely and clean and we all enjoyed the adventure play areas. I'm sure the beach area would be lovely in summer. My only concern is the number of cars driving on resort despite the notices stating you can't do this. I think if Center Parcs use clamps this would stop this if people have to pay fines.  The staff on resort were lovely and helpful. Aqua SanaI attended Aqua Sana for a 3 hour spa session. I found the facilities on offer excellent and very good value for money. My only concern is the noise levels from other guests in the spa who's behaviour at times were unnaceptable but that's not the fault of the staff and they cannot control how others choose to behave.On a whole we will definitely be back. We really enjoyed our time at Center Parcs and wouldn't hesitate to recommend to others. We're already planning our next break.

We paid for the refurbished lodge and paid the extra to choose our location. The location couldn't have been better but the room had really not been looked after and poorly cleaned. The facilities however I was very impressed with cleanliness!! The pool, restaurants, parks and all activities were very well presented. Activites we did were baby balance which was pretty poor, badminton which was great fun and reasonably priced! Bowling again good fun! Kids pottery painting which was really good value and great to have something to keep and mini golf which was poor being only 9 holes! We had good weather for the week which also helped. Highlight was definitely the ducks and deer coming right up to our lodge door which our little one loved!!

To be honest it was lovely, yes maybe bit afraid around the edges but it was clean, and cosy and very quiet.  we had a walk around and from what i could see it was idea for family and those that just want a relaxing holiday, the swimming pool is lovely and well planned out, tho i would say if you can carry your child rather then park your pram it is a lot easier during busier times.Sadly i never really got to see a lot more after this as i pulled my back after the first day and spent the next 3 days on the living room floor before giving up and going home, but would I go again, well yes i really would, we didn't eat out but really enjoyed cooking in our lodge and just relaxing.It really was a lovely place.",0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

Our villa floor was so dirty when we arrived, my feet were filthy within minutes, this clearly needed a deep clean and the time allowed for housekeeping is not sufficient. We had dinner at hucks - ¬£57 for 2 people, which I would expect a really nice meal. The food was average and terribly over priced. This meal was for my birthday and I was really disappointed. My husband swapped sweet potato fries for fries and I swapped the other way round. Yet, I was charged ¬£1.95 to upgrade (the price difference as sides is 75p??), despite ordering the same as the original menu but just on different plates. Our waitress (Harriett) was not attentive and we were left waiting a long time to order drinks or food or for our bill and when we questioned the bill, were given a really difficult attitude, not what you would expect from a customer facing role. Considering customers are not allowed to use cars, which I think is excellent, there was so much construction traffic going through the park, it made walking with the pram and dog unenjoyable and noisy.

I had the impression that the experience would be less good than we had remembered, and certainly more crowded. However, I was very pleasantly surprised, and felt the lovely surroundings and overall outdoors/nature experience were just as good as ever.We had a 4-bedroom executive lodge in the 'Pine' area, and it was impressively well-equipped and clean on arrival. The daily servicing was excellent too. We were there from Monday to Friday, and there was a towel change on Wednesday. Small toiletries were provided, and a daily supply of dishwasher tablets.The only negative about the lodge was that the gas oven was a real challenge to light u2013 we did manage but it always took numerous attempts and a long time.The hired bicycles were in excellent condition (and better than advertised when we booked them on the website u2013 I think the website said traditional bicycles didn't have gears, but ours definitely did!)The outdoor facilities that we used u2013 notably the children's play areas and the outdoor tennis courts u2013 were in good condition.My only slight disappointment with the facilities was the pool. It was probably not too different to the one I remember best from years ago at Longleat, except the outdoor part seemed smaller and there was no gentle ride (I remember something called the 'Lazy River' at Longleat u2013 I don't know if it still exists). A lot seems to be given over here to the more thrill-seeking flumes! However, the toddler area was nice for our grandchild.  The changing cabins have a good system - two doors, one side to come in with your outdoor shoes, the other side to go out in bare feet to the lockers and pool - but were rather crowded and chaotic when we were there.  We did see staff trying to clean up, but they were up against a challenge u2026 Looking for a vacant cabin, we found a used nappy in one, screwed up tissues in another, and a banana skin in a third. Some of us went on an early morning walk with a Ranger, which was very interesting and a nice way to start the day. Some members of the party also went to Aqua Sana and seemed very pleased with their experiences. Although mostly self-catering, we used the Foresters' Inn, Sports Bar and Caf√© Rouge once each. We were particularly impressed by the Caf√© Rouge for excellent attention to the requirements of one of our party who has food allergies. (Not only was the allergy book checked, but the waiter had clearly communicated well with the kitchen, and the food came out with a little flag to say it had none of the specified allergens u2013 Wonderful service!)Finally, we used the Parcmarket several times and were happy with the range and price of goods it stocked.

Despite being told that there was a 96% occupancy rate when we visited, it never felt crowded.

We did go to one of the young children's paint-a-pot sessions which was very well run.We self-catered, though did visit the pancake house one morning for a very nice pancake breakfast.My only complaint would be that it isn't very suitable for high-energy dogs, such as our young cocker spaniel. However it is very dog-friendly if you have an older dog, or a breed that doesn't need much exercise. There are a few fenced-in &quot;dog exercise&quot; areas around the park, but they aren't very big. Dogs need to be kept on leads everywhere else. They could do with a big grassy park area where dogs could have a good run around after a ball, or be allowed off the lead on the perimeter woodland path.

The sub-tropical swimming paradise was without a doubt the highlight of our holiday, we visited every day and sometimes multiple times a day. The changing room area was plenty big enough with adequate sized lockers, the key system using your wristbands was very innovative and meant you couldn't forget where your stuff was. As for the pool itself, I loved the Cyclone and the rapids, the slides were nice additions too, though some (the white slides in particular) weren't monitored at all and some people nearly ended up injured. The wave machine was a bit touch and go as sometimes the water barely even moved, while others the waves were a couple of feet high, but I feel this may have depended on the number of people in the pool at the time.My only complaints about the whole trip would be that some of the locations given on the website for where activities took place didn't match up to where you actually had to meet - we had to ask for help on a couple of occasions. Also, the utensils given in the lodge weren't necessarily good enough for the 6 of us, so I'm not sure how they would have coped if we had a full lodge of 8 people. There was 1 frying pan, which was awful quality and also very few cooking utensils.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0

The children's play facility inside wasn't as good as before - perhaps the reason families were avoiding it.Halloween Party at the venue was good value and kids loved the entertainment.Huge thank you to Zack for the Falconry experience - very knowledgeable and has a great rapport with the kids and parents alike - definitely the highlight of our stay.Booked again for next year already!,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

Note you will need ¬£1 coin for the lockers. These lockers are in reality for single use! Back to the car to drive to our 4 bed lodge. Signs for the area of the lodge are small! Arrived at the lodge - this was excellent. 4 bedrooms all with en-suite. Beds comfortable. All very clean. Spacious open living area. We took all our own food and drink! BBQ- you have to buy their own disposable ones. I think it cost ¬£7. This was in my opinion poor. I took my own charcoal expecting a traditional BBQ! We booked ten pin bowling and table tennis. Enjoyable! I took my bike and had a good ride round! Probably the best way to get around! All staff very friendly! I thought the optional activities were a bit expensive but I guess the overheads are high! We paid about ¬£1800 for the 4 bed lodge 3 night stay. Our lodge included a pool table!

To give them due they responded very quickly. It wasn't the cleanest having found a nail clipping on the rug in the main room. Also it needed a total renovation as the paint was peeling around the windows.

The interior although supposedly new was very tired. The toilet seat didn't fit the toilet and was very disappointed that with the 8 of us only 2 toilets.  My own fault for not checking the details but a main bathroom and separate shower room without a toilet really isn't sufficient.  It seems like Center Parcs are spending more money on the luxury treehouses and waterside villas than on the other lodges.  It also felt for the first time that more accommodation is being built and cramped in and the facilities haven't expanded to make up for it.  Also the showers were partly shut for refurbishing at the pool but the ones that remained kept running cold. Staff  weren't there usual happy selves and service seemed down on previous years with glasses and plates being slammed down when being served.

We hired bikes and litterally didn't walk anywhere. From the moment we left the lodge to getting back for bedtime we were on our bikes. We explored the woods and other areas with ease and I felt safe letting my 8 year old out cycling on the roads and paths because of the limited cars arrangement throughout the village. The restaurants and amenities were accessible and very enjoyable too. My son thoroughly enjoyed the quad bikes, the aerial adventure and the laser combat but most of all he enjoyed the simple fun we had just exploring the grounds on our bikes.

groupe_3,"We were 6 in the party, two grandchildren their parents and us, the grandparents.We stayed a week in one of the new Executive 4 Bed lodges. At almost ¬£600 a night it felt expensive so we went expecting appropriately high levels of accommodation, service and park amenities.The lodge itself was fine, and appeared fairly new  with 4 en-suite bedrooms, good living space, kitchen, games room etc. We only had one problem when the lights went out during the course of one night. We phoned Guest Relations in the morning and an electrician came and fixed it very promptly (faulty outside light which kept tripping the fuse ).The range of activities is wide but nearly all come at an extra price ( the pool and the playgrounds are free ) so whilst the children were able to try out a good number of new experiences, the adults had the feeling that they were constantly having to pay up for yet another thing, and not always good value for money. The younger members of our group hired bikes which worked well. The older ones enjoyed walking around what is an attractive woodland environment.That particular lodge comes with a daily cleaning service involving bed making, cleaning of the floors,and periodic change of towels. On day 1 all went to plan. The next day the maid just did the beds and ignored the floors. On day 3 no one came until I phoned Guest Relations at 5pm. Two maintenance people then arrived saying they had come to change the waste bins. In fairness, when we said we were expecting a little more they also did the beds and the floors. On day 4 the maid did the beds, missed the floors and left the old towels in the bathrooms but put a laundry bag containing  8 sets of clean  towels on the dining table. We duly did the towel change ourselves and put the used towels in the bag in the hallway. The following day the maid removed the bag from the hallway to the front of the lodge ( outside ) where it remained for the next two days.. Later that day someone turned up in the afternoon and dumped two large bags which were apparently containing the bed linen and towels which would be needed for the next occupants arriving two days later. Not something to make an existing guest feel particularly welcome.The pool is looking a bit dated. The changing rooms were rather dirty and the water in the pool was not very clean.We ate out in Caf√© Rouge, Hucks, Forresters, and The Pancake House. Hucks was the best of a pretty average lot but extremely noisy ( ask for a table away from the children's play area ). We had home delivery two nights which was also pretty average and none too warm by the time it reached us.All in all then, a decent property but at a price for which I would expect far better service, at least some eateries offering something a little higher quality than was the case and a feeling that money wasn't being extracted from me at every turn, especially when it represented questionable value for the cost involved.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0

Perhaps washing behind the door when washing the floor might be a good idea, don't think it has been done since it was built.What do the maintenance staff do, go round blindfolded?  The carpets were filthy, kept our socks or slippers on at all times, the grout in the bathroom is very hit and miss, the extractor fan in the kitchen has more grease than the local chippy and the windows are clearly a mystery to the window cleaner if there is such a person.The cars on the park are not patrolled with lots of cars returning to the car park on Saturday morning, i.e. the first morning when the kids just want to get out there on their bikes.  The signage is poorly lit when it is dark, again, not safe for kids and the Monday morning exit is not only chaos but dangerous.  Why, if you have to be out of the lodges for 10.00 a.m. and the new arrivals are supposed to arrive from 3.00 p.m. do they send every service vehicle known to man onto the park, including large lorries and hordes of staff of bikes?  This is dangerous, staff should start after 10.00 a.m. and new arrivals should not be allowed, for safety reasons until after mid day to reduce the amount of traffic on the park.

The log burner - I can't book the hotel at CP because the rooms don't have a log burner. I love watching the tv with the fire roaring underneath. Amazing huge windows to see outside. Lovely.It's quad biking track is much better than Elvedon (Woburn doesn't have one). One man suffered bruising to his ribs during the rapids which impacted his break so be careful. I went down many times safely and loved it. The swimming area is under par and is being redone which is much needed so I shan't comment on that. All staff are friendly, proactive and interested, this was especially the case in Starbucks. As the queues for Starbucks can be quite large I appreciate their experienced staff members who showed that concern and made the time to chat and the equally bubbly characters in the village square serving happily at 08:00 in the morning. All eating out experiences were good, great presentation and food.The Parcs Marc for me is not disappointing because of its price - you know with CP it's expensive but I consider it worth it. It's disappointing because it's quality of food is rubbish. Some of the things were just inedible. And we tried Dining In to make the most of a romantic time not cooking and sitting by the fire and this arrived cold. So we won't be getting that again but we will return to Centre Parcs. I wish we lived closer to Elvedon or Nottingham but we live closest to Woburn.As always, super fun. I wish I could afford to go next year but we will endeavour to return.

groupe_3,"I had booked to attend centre parcs on 5th November with my partner, unfortunately I had to cancel the booking due to my partner being in an accident and suffering extensive burns. I attempted to change the booking (it does say on the terms and conditions for centre parcs they will try and accommodate this if you are prevented from taking your break) however was told with absolutely no sympathy whatsoever that 8 weeks notice was required for this.  On cancelling the break I went back on the website to check and my suspicions were correct - the lodge had immediately been put out to be booked by someone else.  I am very disappointed that centre parcs are so inflexible and money orientated, this has been an extremely distressing time and to be spoken to with absolutely no sympathy or compassion has not helped the situation.  Its also laughable how the price of the lodges are ridiculously overpriced already without them being able to get double the fee from other peoples misfortune. disgusting.",0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,0.0,,0.0,
groupe_3,"This was our first trip to Centre Parcs and it was very enjoyable. There is lots to consider when booking your trip so I have split it into sections as it can be a little daunting if it is your first visit to Centre Parcs. Checking in and out - as all guests are either booked in mon to fri or fri to mon then guests are checking in and out on the same days. We arrived on the Monday afternoon. You can't check in to your accommodation till 3pm so be mindful arriving between 2 and 4 as there could be a big queue to get in especially in schoolHolidays. Once you have checked in you drive to your lodge where you have an hour or so to unpack and then drive your car back to the main car park. Depending on where your accommodation is it could be a bit of a walk back to your accommodation if you don't have bike. Similarly checking out everyone will be going to get their cars, load up and drive out around the same time, so you may find if you leave between 9 and 10 am it might be a bit backed up. Accommodation - you can pay extra when booking to have accommodation in certain areas (check the park map on line). We booked an executive lodge with housekeeping and were told generally the lodges with housekeeping are in good locations as the housekeeper needs to get there everyday. So we didn't bother with paying the extra to choose a lodge. We had a great location in Maple, only a short bike ride to the main centre of the park but easily walkable too. We had a two bedroom executive lodge. It was very clean and well equipped. The kitchen had a dishwasher, microwave, fridge, hob and oven and even a wine fridge. The housekeeping service was well worth it as it was nice to come back to the lodge and it was hovered and beds made, bathroom and kitchen clean etc. Our towels were changed after 2 days too. When we arrived at the lodge there was quite an unpleasant smell coming from the kitchen sink. We called guest services and they sent somebody round very promptly to fix it and it was fine after that. Similarly we couldn't work out the oven one evening and again somebody was sent fairly promptly to help us.Getting around the park - We hired bikes. Two adult bikes with a child seat and child helmet hire was ¬£80. We didn't really need the bikes as we re in a good location but it was good fun to ride around. If you have your own bikes then save the cost of hire and try to take your own. Getting around is fairly easy to navigate however we did get lost a few times as signs seemingly seemed to stop on route. We also went out of the park on 2 evenings and found riding back in the dark could have been more illuminated.Activities - There isn't a huge range of activities for under 3 but certainly enough to keep our 2 year old occupied. One morning we booked Pots with Tots. You go to the pottery studio, pick a piece of pottery and your little one can paint it. You all get your own little table so my husband and I could both sit with him which was nice and get involved too. When you are done, they prepare your piece which you collect the next day, so a nice thing to take with you.We also booked a morning session of Mucky Pups. It's basically messy play session, so play dough, water and sand table, painting, etc. Again our little one enjoyed it.The outside play areas were well equipped and our son loved the swings etc so visited there most afternoons.Bowling - Bowling is charged by time so 45 mins or 60 mins. It cost us ¬£28 for a 45 minute session which I thought was quite expensive. Afterwards there was a small soft play area for little ones. There was a large bar area at the bowling.Beach - The beach area is lovely but not huge so again if you are going in school holidays I can imagine it would get pretty busy down there. I saw there were sunbeds down there but not sure if they are chargeable or now.Swimming -  We booked a family cabana at the swimming centre. It was ¬£50 for 3 hours which is pretty expensive, but it was handy for us. So when you arrive at the swimming centre you go into the changing rooms which have lockers and were pretty smelly, reminded me of school. You then go through to the swimming pool. If you have a cabana booked go to the desk with the inflatables and somebody will show you to the cabana. The cabana is quite fun, it has a fridge with some soft drinks, a tv and a safe and towels. It was handy for us because our son is still a bit nervous around the swimming pool and wanted to get out after 20 minutes, so was good to take him to the cabana, have a drink and something to eat and then go back into the pool when he was ready. If you don't have a cabana then there aren't a huge amount of areas for you to get out and chill for a bit. There are chairs dotted around the bool and pool restaurant. We only ate in one of the resort eateries. That was the pool restaurant. It was basic food that you would expect from these sorts of places, but filled a hole. Restaurants - We didn't eat in any of the other centre parcs restaurants because they are very much chain places and burger joints which isn't really for us. I took breakfast shopping with me, for lunch times, we would buy fresh rolls from the Parc market and the evenings we ate out at nearby eateries not far from the resort including Tuddenham Mill, Elveden Inn and The Cadogan. Worth noting that the supermarket at Centre Parcs is well stocked with everything you need but very expensive so well worth taking shopping with you. I think there is a Sainsburys a short drive from there too.All in all it was an enjoyable stay and our 2 year old loved it. All of the staff we dealt with were friendly and helpful. Generally the whole place was clean. I would definitely revisit but probably not somewhere I would enjoy at busy times like school holidays.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0
groupe_3,"A group of 6 of us went to Center Parcs Elveden for the first time for a long weekend and was pleasantly surprised!!  Getting there was easy and the instructions were pretty clear when we arrived.  We found the lodge easily and were very happy with it.  It was clean and had enough space, even though it looked bigger in the pictures.  We even had a welcome note on the blackboard from Housekeeping!  We thought toilet paper would be included with the house, but apparently not...so make sure you bring at least one roll and the rest you can get from the shop on site.We immediately hired our bikes and went to the Aqua Sana spa, which is AMAZING!!!!  Sooooo relaxing with a variety of saunas and lounging areas.  Very peaceful, and very good value for money!!!  My friend had been given a key that didn't fit her padlock but we called the Customer Service number which was on our map and they put us through to the Cycle Centre who came within 10 minutes to change it.We had a bit of a problem finding our way back to the lodge as it was pitch black but the bikes had lights and eventually using the map we found our way home.  What an adventure!!!We spent the whole weekend cycling around and exploring, taking pictures of the beautiful scenery and just chilled out.  The swimming pool is large, with a few slides, rapids and a hilarious ride with a drop at the end.  Not for the faint hearted but very fun!!!The air is so clean and you really feel at one with nature.  100% recommend a visit to Center Parcs!!!!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,1.0

We really felt like we got away from it all, we rambled through the woods, had our own 'garden' to play in. We made good use of cycle tracks, though one thing I'd say is signage is poor round the site as a walker, cyclist or driver so just relax into not having a clue where you are. The pool was busy, though actually in the pool area this wasn't really an issue and the children had a fab time, loads of different areas (again signage was poor-didn't know which ride was which) The changing rooms were tricky and very busy but again, we weren't in any rush. Our daughter fell and split her lip within half an hour of arrival and first aid and nurses were on the scene super quickly and were lovely. Our super sensitive fire alarm went off several times and when we rang guest services they sent someone very quickly to give the oven an extra clean, they were prompt and professional. We only booked little archery which was a waste of money, 9 goes of the arrow in half an hour! And we booked into aqua sana, which runs like a military operation but which was lovely and relaxing.

groupe_3,"I've been to Center Parcs a few times in the past but not for years. We booked this break very last minute but managed to get a one bedroom lodge for a reasonable price.We arrived around 6:30pm on the Friday night and had an easy check in - dropped off our bags at the lodge and were able to collect our pre-booked bikes before the Cycle Centre closed. Our lodge was clean and comfortable and was located in the Maple area close to all the main areas. It had all the kitchen items we needed and plenty of space. We had prebooked a pack of logs for the fire but don't forget matches!We tried most of the restaurants and enjoyed them all. Our favourite was Rajinda Pradesh which was particularly good! I'd recommend the set menu experience. The food isn't cheap and it does add up eating out over the course of the break but you could eat in your lodge if required. Over the course of the weekend, we did several activities - badminton, falconry and visited the spa. The falconry experience was excellent - we got up close to lots of different birds of prey and learnt lots from Zach. The spa was amazing and had clearly undergone a recent renovation. We did the twilight session and found all the facilities calm, clean and relaxing. This was definitely a highlight of our trip.We didn't see any construction work going on whilst we were there as other reviews have mentioned but it was a weekend. The swimming pool is currently undergoing renovation which should be amazing when it's done. We didn't spend any time really in the swimming pool but it looked amazing for children! Overall, we had a lovely, relaxing weekend and really enjoyed riding around the forest on our bikes. I'd recommend Center Parcs to families and anyone who is looking for a chilled yet active break.

The cycle ride from CP is on a forest path so not on rural traffic roads. It's perfect for kids too. We took our 3-year old twins and they loved it.I couldn't recommend this CP highly enough.

groupe_3,"I went with my Partner and our Stepson and Stayed in a 2 Executive lodge during the first weekend of October Half term 2018. Firstly the weather was Kind, it was Sunny and relatively warm all weekend. The Autumn colours were out in profusion and just made the stay all the more magical. Firstly the lodge was as described on the website, very clean and comfortable and maid service was excellent. However the Fridge was quite noisy and we couldn't sleep with the bedroom door open. (I'll forgive this as the lodge will get refurbished in due course). I have heard many complaints of Damp smells but we did not really experience this except when we tried to dry our wet towels one evening but this cleared after a short time with the bathroom extractors on. The general park facilities were in excellent condition for 31 years of constant use and it is clear they are still investing in the site with new accommodation units and activity infrastructure since my last visit about 4 years ago. There was a large building site for the expansion of the Sub tropical swimming paradise but I spoke with a staff member who hinted it was a head of schedule and the work was reasonable discreet considering the scale of the work.  The new Ariel Adventure Course and Zip Wire in particular is Awesome! If you have a adventurous streak it is well worth the money for the memories! The falconers club was a bit of a let down as the group was large and the instructor had some trouble keeping order with the kids in the group. Also if you are in the Pine Area the new car park near the country club was excellent.One shortcoming was that there was very limited activities available for an 8 year old unsupervised which meant we did not really get any time to go to the spa this time trip. If CP could improve this offering it would make the world of difference to families like ours The Sub Tropical Swimming Paradise was crowded but there was no significant queuing for any of the flumes or Canopy cafe. I hope with the new extension to the facilities the crowded feel will reduce. I understand after the new extension is build with the new ride and kids area there will be further renovations to existing areas. We all loved the SSP however and made a trip everyday and Twice on Saturday and it made the holiday for us all. I can really  recommend a night time swim in the dark. We ate out a couple of times and the food was of the expected High standards but the prices are on the premium side. We weren't worried as this was expected and we had put together a meal plan before we went and stuck to it all weekend which took a lot of the stress out of it and saved us a fortune, If I could offer one piece of advice it would be plan ahead, Many people complain of the cost but a Center Parcs holiday can be what you make of it. We booked well in advance and paid in instalments, booked all our activities before we even arrived and planned our eating out around that as well and took advantage of very good facilities in the lodge and compared to some trips I have made I saved a bundle this time. The staff were all very friendly and all of them gave their time to chat and make us feel very welcome. I would say they were all a credit to the place. It was my partners first trip and she was so impressed we have already booked again for the same time next year. On balance I have had several trips to CPs across the UK in the last 20 years and I was even an employee for a short time in their call centre some years ago. And I can say this was one of the best ones I have had there. Overall an Awesome holiday.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

A group of seven with one instructor. Meaning six people mooching about waiting for their turn. Over the course of two hours, my kids did four short climbs. That could have been one hour OR eight climbs if the guy sat on his bum with a clipboard joined in.But it has to be said, CP is a nice well kept place.

groupe_3,"We stayed in one of the new executive 3-bed lodges which have been built with the added benefit of a hot tub, meaning that smaller families like ours no longer have to stump up for an exclusive lodge if we want that particular luxury.I do feel that CP should make it clear on the booking site that these new lodges are not &quot;nestled in the forest&quot; like the website suggests. They have, in fact, been built on what was the old golf driving range so at present they are a bit out in the open! Hopefully the trees fill in a bit over the coming years.The lodge was of the new style that will be familiar to anyone who has stayed at Woburn. Visually more attractive than the original lodges from the outside but the design has an annoying flaw which means that one of the bedrooms looks out onto next door's patio/BBQ area so you'd best hope you don't have noisy neighbours! The original lodges don't have this flaw so I'm unsure why the newer ones have been designed in this way. As per previous times we've been to CP they still seem to think a standard double bed is appropriate for executive accommodation - surely in this day and age when Premier Inn can install a king size bed they could do the same? The new media hub was good, though, and made up for the lack of programming included as you could plug a Fire TV stick in if you wanted to watch a movie.Elsewhere around the village everything is pretty familiar.

Hopefully they will see fit to redo the changing areas and extend them a bit in due course as the facilities seem rather inadequate at busy times and are looking tired.Overall it was a good stay and as per my earlier comments it is good to see CP listening to feedback and providing the option of luxuries like hot tubs to a wider audience.

Stayed Mon-Fri at a cost of ¬£1200.Lodge had a damp musty smell in the bedrooms &amp; was very tired looking .also the sink area had a strong smell . Having stayed at Elvedon &amp; Woburn  we didn't expect the lodge to have these issues . The Parc itself is lovely the weather was dry each day so the children could enjoy all the play areas &amp; the beach. The tropical pool area is not as good as Woburn .

We arrived at our supposedly newly refurbished lodge and was very disappointed. The lodge is exactly as I remember from when I visited 8 years ago? It didn't feel particularly clean, the toilet seat is stained and past it's best, the outside patio area is covered in stinging nettles and is very unkept. I would expect even minimum patio maintenance so the space actually feels usable. The TV/media Center is very difficult to use, it's not user friendly and wasn't compatible with any of our up-to-date devices. Everything just seems to be done with bare minimum effort or desire, but charged at a premium price. The swimming area is good, however the Canopy Cafe is absolutely terrible. I was greeted by a very miserable woman who grunted at us. We all ordered a burger and fries meal which cost over ¬£10. When the food came out the same server threw our food on to the table with such force that fries went flying. It was completely unprofessional. The food was appalling quality, very cheap burgers and tasteless fires. Again, premium price for cheap crap. You are very aware of the constant attempt from Center parks to extort even more cash from you. Would I return? I'm undecided at present.We could probably find something more special than what Center Parcs is at present, on Air B&amp;B. ",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0

We picked Sherwood Forest as it's cheaper than our more local Elveden and it actually feels like you've been somewhere.Centre Parcs never disappoints.  We have tried all the activities before so thought we'd try to cut costs by taking own bikes and not booking any extras.  It has still been fab and it's been affordable so hoping to be able to come again next year.  We would like to bring our dog but will have to get in quickly before all the dog villas are snapped up again.We have spent the week cycling/running through Sherwood Forest as its easy and quick to reach Sherwood Pines from Centre Parcs using this mode of transport (even with children whom don't like cycling usually!)We have been swimming everyday; we all love being able to swim outside.  We have walked around the lake, fed the ducks and checked out the nature centre.  The youngest adores the play areas and we even found 2 in which the eldest couldn't resist checking that her climbing skills hadn't deserted her on reaching her teens.At the villa: we all love watching the wildlife through the patio door and some squirrels have decided they would prefer to join us inside (youngest thinks she's taking one home with her and has named it)The weather has been kind to us, allowing more time outdoors by keeping dry.  However we've visited before and enjoyed snow and rain while in the pool.  We have sat outside the Sports Bar keeping warm from the patio heaters.

The lodge was tired.  the radiators were dirty but the cleaners could not take the covers off.  We had multiple packages left from a dog on the patio which was clearly there for a while so we couldnt use the patio.  No TV remote and when we did get one the sound came out in the bathroom speaker not the bedroom.  Ripped wallpaper and spot lights lose in the ceiling.  All in all we logged over 10 issues with the lodge of which 6 were still outstanding when we left.  They are clearly updating some of the lodges but they need to work faster.  Paying over ¬£700 for a weekend for a 2 bedroom lodge is a premium and as such I would have expected better accommodation.  Marion the house keeper was lovely and by no means was this a reflection on her.  Everything that we logged could not have been handled by housekeeping.  This was upkeep of the property maintenance.  I logged this with guest services but they don't seem to care much.  Shame really as the place is lovely but for the premium I expected a executive experience.

Indoor pool, we were told it would be at temperature of 29 degrees but when we went in it was Luke warm! Activities - indoor climbing was good. Fencing - good to know the moves but there wasn't enough time to put it in practice. Willow workshop - was excellent. Pottery was disappointing, we went there and it was too noisy &amp; busy. We had a look at the pottery range and it was expensive and wasn't worth doing. So we switched to the wildlife walk which was informative - even got to feed ducks.

groupe_3,"We had a lovely few days at Sherwood last weekend. Always enjoy centre parcs and the endless activities, great for children! Just a few niggles this time (stayed multiple times before):We stayed in a 3 bed executive lodge and paid just under ¬£1000 for 3 nights (not inconsiderable money) for this I expect to have clean towels provided with the maid service (apparently we have to order them and pay ¬£6.50 each time). Absolutely fine with keeping the towels initially provided as long as they are clean and dry but as the towels are barely large enough to wrap around your body they soon become soggy (not to mention bathmats). Apparently towels aren't provided for children... when asked what I was supposed to dry the children with I was told we should bring our own. I questioned at what age my child must be before they deem it appropriate to provide a towel... apparently 5 years old...! After a considerably long conversation with guest services about how ridiculous it is to provide 5 towels for 7 occupants they agreed to send us clean towels that evening (they wavered the fee u201cthis timeu201d) which I was pleased about after considering drip drying after my shower! Also, the shower temperature even on the hottest it will go is really not hot enough, getting out of a shower that leaves you cold to a soggy towel was not pleasant. On a different note, the rapids were absolutely chaotic on the Sunday, to the point of becoming hazardous. The lifeguard at the bottom was stopping people from going down the final drop to try and clear the end pool (good idea) but this meant that everyone bottlenecked further up, maybe a little communication between the lifeguards on the rapids or a timed entry might be useful. On the whole we love coming to centre parcs and will continue to return each year with friends and family, there's just a few areas that could really do with a little improvement, it's very expensive to stay and most activities involve extra costs so small things like clean towels and hot water might make us feel that we are getting a little more value for money.",1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,

groupe_3,"We have been visiting CP on and off for about 27 years and generally have a very relaxing and enjoyable time. It's never been the cheapest place to visit but all the activities are clearly priced on the website so everybody can budget accordingly.On this occasion it was my 60th birthday and we chose Sherwood Forest for two Reasons: the renovated Spa is outstanding and the site is within an easy drive of home.We chose our villa based on location. We like to be nearer the periphery than the centre so we elected for an Executive Lodge, close to the Forrester's Inn. It was OK and cleaned to a good standard but was showing signs of wear and tear in places. The sound system in the bathrooms didn't work and the extractor fans were extremely noisy to the point we had to switch off at the mains in order to sleep. The housekeeper had written a birthday greeting in the chalkboard which was a lovely gesture.We spent over ¬£2000 on meals and activities for the 6 of us. We used the spa, had treatments, bike hire, bowling, swimming, caving, tree adventure, quad bikes, badminton. All amazing and treasonably good value for money.However, the pool was very crowded and it was nigh on impossible to get a locker or changing cubicle. I wonder whether for an hour every day the pool could be adult only So that the facilities are not over run with families with young children. The site has built many additional accommodation units but the pool and central hub areas cannot cope with the increased footfall.Eating out is hit and miss. The outstanding restaurant is definitely Rajinda Pradesh. Attentive smart staff superb food and excellent customer service. Foresters inn has always been a must but on this occasion there was insufficient staff for the  number of diners. There were a lot of large parties but only two waiting staff. Portion sizes of protein were child sized and not good value at all. Breakfast at Cafe Rouge was lovely although the waiter was so softly spoken none us could understand a word he said. Bella Italia - really lovely piping hot food, great waitress but very long waiting times. The Sports Cafe in the Jardin ticks most of the boxes if you're happy to be deafened by the football...I think the company owners need to decide if they want customers to largely dine in or out. The vast majority of holiday rentals these days provide a fridge freezer so that families have a range of options. The fridges at CP are small for parties of 4 or 6 adults and most people don't want to be food shopping on a daily basis on holiday. However, when you are dining out there needs to be a wider choice of cuisine and restaurants need to be staffed at levels that ensure diners have a positive experience. We have decided to book a full week break next year but at Longleat which is a much more spacious site, having the largest acreage with the least number of villas.

groupe_3,"Stayed in our usual adapted villa, our last stay was in March and there have been some improvements since then to disabled access Fantastic to find a changing places toilet - this has made such a difference to our holiday we no longer have to go back to our villa to enable my son to have personal care . What was even more surprising was to find on on second visit to the pool improvements being made to disabled changing areas - we were informed by one of the lifeguards that a changing places is being put in the swimming pool changing area and they are planning improvements to the access to the pool . This was music to my ears as I have mentioned in previous CP reviews access to the pool is our biggest problem we manage it but only because my daughter is rather determined and my son loves the pool so much . If our local community swimming pool can manage to provide good disabled access - my son swims three times a week then surely CP can too . More about the pool, we always book a cabana but have previously had to book the 8 person even though there are only 3 of us as it's the only accessible one , a lovely surprise to discover there is now a 6 person accessible one with some lovely new furniture that arrived during our stay a great improvement - thank you CP . A special thank you to Matthew who helped us to our cabana and came back to make sure we were ok .We had a lovely time playing crazy golf, had a go at tennis and p√©tanque - sporty we are not but we had great fun trying A lovely new find for us was pottery painting - my new favourite activity the best fun I've had in ages, I wish we had tried it on previous visits so will be booking up again for our best visit Afternoon tea at Cafe Rouge was a nice treat and very reasonably priced , plenty of food for the three of us and the staff as always were lovely.The sports cafe food is so much better than it used to be, we used to avoid it but our last two visits have changed our minds.Looking forward to our next visit at Christmas to enjoy Winter Wonderland and see what other fun things we can try .",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0

Great woodland walks, and sooooo many things to do, but everything you have to pay for, nothing is included so if u have a family it is a mega exspensive break.Unfortunately we found out to our horror that our cabin neighbours were a bunch of young men who clearly had no regard for anyone else, so for two nights we were kept up by obviously drunken men shouting, screaming, banging, running around outside in the dark till 4am!! We called security twice but it still carried on. So consequently we decided to leave Sunday afternoon as couldn't stand another sleepless night, and to be honest it was quite scary.

We knew centre Parcs had a rep of being expensive but have been told it was very good. The pics in the internet did not reflect the exclusive lodge we stayed in, the whole lodge was dirty, the bathrooms especially. The sound system in all the bathrooms did not work and the remotes did not work on the TVs in the bedrooms. If you want your towels changing the cleaners will not take them you have to book a change at guest services but in the write up it said they were changed daily. The sauna tripped out a few times so we gave up and never bothered. I expected the lodges to be set in the woodland in an eco friendly way, they in my opinion were lumps of square concrete structures plonked in the woods. The beds were comfy!!!  It was tired and run down. ( app they have refurbished some of these lodges but you pay extra) The restaurants were all the same!!! They offered fish steak burgers and some chicken meals but quality was very poor, but pricy. I grabbed a takeaway from in dining, I ordered 4 pizza and 3 chips came to 45 pounds. We decided to go to the children's disco which was located at the temping bowling in the village square, my god for the amount centre Parcs make I would expect the children to be entertained, the DJ put kids songs on with the tv playing the videos to go along side the music and said over and over u201c here we gou201d.The pool is over rated, it is dirty and I mean DIRTY, there was spit on the floor, there were curly hairs everywhere I passed on the showers as the tiles behind them were covered in hairs, I couldn't wait to get out!!! The largest slide had stairs to climb and que the walls were mouldy and there clumps of hairs in every corner, the slides were poor very poor, the rapids were ok and quite funny but are not manned and not watched until you reach the end, please do not let new swimmers/ small children and generally people who can't swim well as you get pushed and knocked into and when you reach the dips you go under and people can go on top of you, I would not let my 11 year old strong boy go on this alone. Very disappointed with the pool.The activites were good very pricy but were good instructing was very professional and made you feel very very safe.Bike hire is a must and was the highlight of our break.There is so much more I wish to say, we have decided  to book our next forest stay at forest holidays please look at this before you book half the price and is defo what you imagine when you want a true forest stay",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,

We ate out every evening, the food was superb in all the locations. As expected it was slightly more expensive than eating in town but the food, drink and service was superb. We tried all the different activity's on offer and was not disappointed, yes we had to pay for some of the water activity's but we knew this before we arrived. Could not fault anything. The staff were attentive, knowledgeable and always cheerful. The swimming pool complex although busy was excellent and we had no bother with changing rooms or lockers. There was a huge extension currently being built on the side of the pool which is due to open in 2019. This will be a great addition to an already excellent pool. We spent 4 days there and have all agreed that we would come back again one day. It does pay to upgrade if you can afford it just for the extra comforts. Yes it was a 10-15 walk from our chalet to the parc centre but the walk was fantastic.

I was then told if we collected it could be quicker but could not be given a time. I was stuck in the first person position for at least half of the time on hold. If someone could of at least answered the call and advised on times that would of been allot better.

The camp is well kept and very pleasant, that's the two stars. The 'updated' lodge was really nothing at all special, it had a coffee machine and usb sockets, that's really it. One of the plug sockets in the main room was loose, the wallpaper peeling and the place a bit grotty. There is no way you should pay extra for this, this should be minimum standard. The pool was ok but the changing areas were quite dirty, the foot pool as you walked in had plasters in it and we were told we couldn't use the biggest slide as my son and I were inbalanced. This was a problem as we have a three year old and couldn't leave her..thus, that was out of the programme for us, this was not the case theree yrs ago. The place is the same as when we visited three yrs ago but with more restrictions..no visible upgrades to the pool. HUCKS! Shocking. Ordered the smokehouse platter. Ribs were tough, over cooked, dry etc etc..just bad. Brisket was like cardboard, rest was ok. Brought it to the waitress' attention and she brought more (better) ribs, but was told the brisket was the same so there was no point replacing it. No other offer or discount was made. Additionally, there was an ill fitting plug socket in the bathroom. I'm a technical engineer with an eye for detail. I refrained from visiting customer services to complain as they expect you to as. quite honestly I wanted to enjoy the break with my family as I have for the past four years and not spend my time haggling over minutiae compensation with the desk staff.

groupe_3,"We've never visited any of the centre parcs sites before and it's somewhere that friends have recommended to us in the past.Our lodge is in the birch area which is located near the village square which contains the restaurants, shops and swimming areas so that's a huge plus point. However we had to pay an additional ¬£60 on top of the basic lodge price for this which we did because we have a 4 and 7 year old with us.The lodge when we arrived was clean and welcoming and seemed well equipped from first glance. The beds for ourselves personally are too hard and I found the first nights sleep not very restful if I'm honest. Our children however seemed to sleep well.Whilst we have been here it's become apparent that this isn't really what we expected from the experience. Firstly the activities available on site are very expensive. For instance cupcake decorating for under 7's is ¬£11.50 per child and I believe the 8-12 years age range was advertised as ¬£25 per child on the information channel in the lodge. With 2 children it's far too much to pay out for quiet a short activity.We did prebook the pottery painting thinking it would be nice for having a keepsake to take home. However what I didn't realise at the time is the money you pay before hand (which is ¬£20 for 2 adults and 2 children) only basically covers your entrance into the studio. To actually continue with the activity is roughly a further ¬£11 per head. This isn't exactly helping families who want to try and make the most of their experience here as you find you have to think very carefully about what you really want to do during your visit.We have visited the swimming area today which we did enjoy and spent a good hour and half there, with it being the only free activity on site bar walking around or if you have brought your own bicycles it is very busy in the area as would be expected however still enough room to comfortably move about so I'm sure we will go again whilst we are still here.It is lovely that the wildlife are tame enough to come close to your lodge and the children have been very excited to watch them from a safe distance indoors.I have heard other sites are better but I still don't think it's enough to justify me spending the amount of money we have spent so far up to date so I can't see us returning",0.0,,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0

I asked them to show me and as explained above, so they put say, 50p in a machine that was a pound and it obviously wouldn't work, so we put another 50p in and it still wouldn't work.

groupe_3,"My partner and I booked a two bedroom lodge for a Monday to Friday holiday mid September, the park looked beautiful as it was on the cusp of autumn. Due to the time and how early we booked, we found it was going to be much cheaper to book a two bedroom lodge and have the ability to self cater than a double room in the hotel or a one bed apartment. It also allowed us to be more involved with the forest life.We were welcomed to our lodge by a muntjak just a few feet from our bedroom window, and saw many more throughout the week, along with squirrels and a Peacock down by the beach.The lodge itself was exactly the same as any other basic Centre Parcs lodge, though unfortunately I felt like this one was less clean, especially the curtains. However it was well stocked with all the necessary items to cater for yourself. We hired bikes for the week due to not being able to transport our own, while this was very expensive it was much nicer to have bikes to go and explore the whole area on so I would recommend trying to take your own to save money. Following on with the financial side of things, I felt like you need to really be sensible with which activities you book. Things like bowling are much more expensive than bowling outside of Centre Parcs, I would recommend only spending money on things that really embrace the location you're in, such as booking out a boat to enjoy the lake. Similarly, I would also advise only going to the restaurants you wouldn't find elsewhere, we went to Hucks as it's somewhere we wouldn't be able to go to any other day of the week from our own home. It's also worth noting that with bikes, your free access to the swimming pool and some imagination, there is plenty to do for the week without booking any activities at all. My main and only issue with the park itself is that it is far too dark at night on the pathways. It is stated in the welcome book that this is to help reduce the effect on the nature but, especially going into winter, I feel like it is just too dark to get around comfortably. Even as two relatively sensible adults we managed to find ourselves going round in circles on the bike ride back from the spa on our last night, and that's having already had plenty of time to try and get our barings. The signs aren't lit at night and without bike lights or carrying torches you really could get very lost.

It's been 3 years since I last did Sherwood and although i had a great time as usual, I can't help but feel aspects of the complex feel dingey and dated. We had 2 lodges across 12 of us, the first thing everyone said in both lodges as we sat down on the couches is 'what is that smell?! The couches have not changed since i can remember, they smell old and damp as soon as your are near them. The living room rugs are also looking very worn and stained, they just look dirty. These are small things but Centre Parcs is not cheap so you just expect more, my house feels cleaner than the living room section of the lodges. Apart from this, the standard villas are not too bad! Previous more luxurious ones we have stayed in have been fine. One thing to be careful of, we used one of the glass pyrex bowls in the oven to cook some nachos, when we took it out, it exploded, twice and covered the kitchen, Guest Services quickly sorted this but maybe don't use them in there!The Subtropical 'Paradise' - Yes, Centre Parcs are adding a new bit on which is much needed but, refurbishment is desperately needed to the current facility. Using the word paradise is a joke at this point, it feels dirty in there, it's like being taken back to the 80's. Its just NEEDS updating. We got in the hot whirlpools then got straight back out because it was not a nice experience, it just feel grubby and old. The rubber ring slide entrance and que is dark and dreary. All the old paintings on the walls and grotty tiles in the pools along with the dated and PACKED changing rooms, night or day, make you feel like you can't wait to get out and get a shower back at the villa asap. It just desperately needs modernising and freshing up.Dining - If you don't book way in advance then you are going to struggle, if you want to use the take away service, be prepared to wait hours! Centre Parcs is rammed now, there is new lodges popping up every years and 'the Village' facilities are stretched! Some new restaurants and cafes are much needed!The Leisure Bowl - again, needs updating! There's a little soft play area in there for kids under 5, it one of only a few indoor places for young children that sort of age there is but this is just another part of Centre Parcs that has never had a face lift over the years and you can tell. It's more like an old Wetherspoons instead of the luxury that is associated with CP. Here's the problem, we all love it here and we will all be back again next year despite all this and i think Centre Parcs know that they can get away with these things and are just getting the most out of everything that they can, it's a business i get it however, this place has only ever got more and more expensive over the years so something needs to give.",1.0,-1.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0

The finish of the property was worn out and unfortunately its clear experienced tradesman were not used to refurbish the lodge. Paint was bodged and the kitchen cupboards were on their last legs and as silly as it sounds only 2 small loo rolls to service up to 8 people for a weekend but its ok as the shop is open till 4 on sunday!!My parents came with us, both suffer with mobility issues so used the free shuttle service. I must say this was very efficient except theres no phone signal and no phones in the lodges so this meant walking to the local phone box. Fine for us but not ideal if no one there to help you if you need the service. Not the most logical of concepts.The park and land itself is nice and clean and swiming pool was clean and entertaining. Just a shame that was the end of the free entertainment. Everything is extra and the prices are inflated and not the easiest to book. Appears you have to be able to see into the future to be able to plan every hour of the day otherwise the choice on the day is limited.The restaurants avaliable on site are varied but poor quality. Mass produced, over priced. Theres just no where to have a decent meal. Having had poor experience before on a previous trip we avoided Hucks and only went for the Pancake factory and Foresters in. The pancake factory was a massive dissapointed. We had mixture of pancakes and omelettes. Its shocking how you can get something so simple wrong and then charge an criminal amount for them. Give it a wide birth!! The foresters was exceptable for a sunday roast but no time or effort put into it. Staff were helpful enough though.On the last evening we decided on a take away. Having no phone signal and no phone in the lodge i had to walk up the road and then stand there in the dark. 3 times i called Dine In all being 2nd in line before being cut off. The 4th time i again was 2nd in line..... For 22minutes (27 in total) to have some young chap shrug off the wait offer no apology and said id have to wait another hour to hour and a half. (2130 - 2200). This is no good with a 5 and 8 year old so it was the scraps from the fridge for dinner.Over all its a good concept but the big boses have lost touch with the real world.

groupe_3,"We stayed at Center Parcs Eleveden Forest in a New Woodland Lodge. We previously went in February and stayed in a standard Woodland Lodge, however there wasn't much difference between the two lodges if I am completely honest, and I felt like the lodge in February was actually bigger than the one we stayed in recently.We bought our own food and cooked inside the lodge, however a couple of the nights we had eaten out. We had eaten in the Bella Italia which was a nice meal, however they had forgotten a few items that we ordered and also gave us dirty wine glasses which we changed, but apart from them little things it was a nice reasonable meal. We then had a lunch meal in the pancake house which was really good. The food was very nice and a good standard and the prices weren't too bad. The last night we had a meal in Hucks. The food options are quite limited and the waitress herself was very pleasant but also very slow. She had forgot various items we had ordered again but she made this up by not charging us for them items and still giving them to us. The quality of the food was also very nice.We had a mud bath in the Spa which again was very good and the spa itself is brilliant and well worth the money. On other reviews there's a lot of mention about the loud noise of Aircraft taking off. This is right. You do get used to it, however they are fighter jets taking off and sometimes it is literally from 8am all the way through to 4pm. Around 4pm it's as if they fly over the forest because the rumbling gets considerably louder.Overall my experience was fantastic and me and my partner always enjoy returning to Center Parcs. It's a nice quiet place to get away and relax. One thing I would suggest is possibly buying smokeless logs before your arrival from somewhere other than Center Parcs. Me and my partner bought smokeless logs from Wilkinson for ¬£1 each, instead of ¬£4.50 in Center Parcs for one.

We wanted to take part in activities but only ended up doing the high ropes/zip wire. Activities including bike hire are approx ¬£25-¬£30 per person. With 8 of us that would equal ¬£200-¬£240 per activity. Very very expensive and quite ridiculous. We would have spent ¬£1000 over 4 days just for 1 hour activity per day.

The cleaners also left a bottle of cleaning fluid in reach of my daughter's cot which was very hazardous and could have caused her harm.

groupe_3,"I want to just start this review saying that my family and I have been going to Whinfell from when it was an Oasis, we've always loved it there, but we fancied trying Sherwood forest as an alternative.The quick review is - For our group, ageing 23-56 Whinfell is a far superior park. Much more to to at the pool for adults who haven't really grown up yet. The only thing Whinfell lacks is some wild rapids! So here's a longer review:Pros of Sherwood Forest:- Everything is in within walking distance. We were on the outer (Maple 67) and the walk to the pool takes 5 minutes.- Debs R from Starbucks - literally the nicest woman you'll ever meet- The outdoor rapids - much more superior to Whinfell's canyon ride. - Lodge was cleanCons of Sherwood Forest:- We were served/greeted by approx 15 members of staff on our trip. 3 stood out as good (the nice lady in the Gelato shop, Deb's R from Starbucks and the lady from the Dine In take away) the rest off the staff members were either rude or miserable. The staff at Bella Italia, where we popped in on the first day treated us like we were in the wrong for going for a pizza. 2 of our group have worked in hospitality/retail and I can honestly say some of the staff at this site need to be trained in how to be polite to people.- The pool area - half the size of Whinfell, with 3 whirl pools, which all had children under 5 years in at one point or another. Life guards didn't seem phased by that even though the signs advise against it. They advised us however no taking photos of the pool unless we had nobody else in them (fair enough, except we'd seen countless families with digital camera's taking pictures during the day). We also were advised that you can't take your go-pro down the rapids. Something that surprised us as there was no warning on the sign at the top of the ride? And the only people in the video were in our group. The large indoor pool freezing. Not a subtropical paradise! - The Grand Cascade - we went for a night swim hoping to get onto the grand cascade ride at night. It said that it shuts at 7/7.30 however when we went to queue up at 6.45 it was roped off. This left everyone with the flumes or rapids. - Lodge - for a 'self-catering' site the amenities are lacking. One spoon for cooking with, no frying pan. No oven proof casserole pot (all things we've had at Whinfell). The dishwasher was also faulty - once it had done its full cycle and finished, it then went on to repeat the same cycle until you turned it off. - Lodge - One small bathroom (and one outdoor loo) between 6 people is a bit of a squeeze. The curtains all had a musty smell.All in all, we'd never return to Sherwood forest again. And as much as we entertained ourselves on the trip (causing it to not be ruined) we all can't help but say that if Whinfell is a much, much, much better site, and we can't wait to go back to our usual. My sister put it best, Sherwood Forest you're alright, but you're no Whinfell.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,-1.0

I have to say after our experience at woburn we was eager to come again this year with the addition of my 8 month old son and 8 month old niece. We decided to stay this time for 5 days and upon arriving was extremely excited to start our first proper family holiday with the children. We had booked an executive lodge as we were blown away with how amazing it was at woburn. When walking in to lodge we slightly disappointed that it didn't seem as big as the one that we stayed in at woburn however it still looked nice. After choosing our rooms my sister and I had issues with setting up our travel cots due to the lack of space in the bedrooms (obviously didn't really think about this as at woburn we didn't have the babies). After pushing the bed up to the window we managed to get the travel cot set up however my husband who slept near the window soon noticed there was a gap in the window letting a draft in during the night (we did check to make sure it was closed correctly). Our little boy was not sleeping great in the travel cot so we thought we would try the cot that centre parcs provided. The cot provided was absolutely filthy, covered in cob webs and spiders definitely not fit to put my 8 month old son in, I was extremely disappointed by this. The bad did not end there. My husband and I cycled down to the aqua sana spa with our little one to book a three hour spa session for the following day (luckily we had family with us that would be able to look after our little one when we went to spa) on our cycle there one of the spokes broke on the wheel of the trailer that our son was in, we returned this and were given a replacement (staff at cycle centre was very helpful) however on our last night we were out later than we had been any other night so it was dark when cycling back to our cabin, it was at this point we realised the replacement bike with the trailer my husband had been given had lights that did not work, seriously not impressed by this point. We also experienced major issues with our oven, it took 50 minutes to cook fish fingers (set to 200 degrees C) , I was also disappointed with how bad the kitchen utensils were or the lack off. I would like to put some positives in, we absolutely loved the swimming pool probably the best one out of the ones I have been to.

The vast majority of these cars were for the three o'clock entry as they were directed to the car park to wait. Very disappointed that despite us paying an additional fee to avoid all this queuing we still ended up waiting 40 mins.There should be a way of early entry customers actually being able to use the privilege they have paid for.Once we found the lodge, I did our normal task of cleaning all the serfaces myself and loading the dishwasher with all the crockery etc we would use this week. Having seen notices around the site about a sickness bug I wasn't taking any chances.Very disappointed to see a dirty bathroom, only one loo roll, not even a spare one, shocking given the price we pay for the lodge.We decided to cook an early evening meal, but on looking in the oven, it was filthy. The oven tray had burnt food in it still, the grill pan had what apperead and smelt like bacon fat still on the grill shelf. This all went in the dishwasher immediately, it was so bad we had to do the cycle twice as the grease still was evident after one wash.I rang customer services and yes the did apologise, and did the following day give us a voucher for the inconvenience, but it would have been nice not to have spend time, effort and money to clean the lodge on our arrival.( purchased cleaning products, dishwasher tablets, loo rolls etc from the expensive onsite shop ).The lodge is looking very tired, bedroom curtains have what looks like black felt tips marks all over, the shelf in the bathroom came coming away from the wall every time an item was placed on it, the kitchen utensils were bent, damaged or missing.It was a nightmare trying to use the oven as the dials had no numbers on them, obv over time they had disappeared, making timings and oven temperature a nightmare gauging.

Even the staff whom I've managed to pursuade to help me taking the cannabis smelt duvet said the smell is very intense.

groupe_3,"We went to Elveden Forest for a 5 day break just after school term started and had a great holiday. It was much cheaper and extremely good value for money.There were lots of families with under school age children which were well catered for.  The swimming pools are beautifully clean and well staffed, the changing rooms plentiful with easy to use lockers. The wrist bands open your front door as well as your swim locker so no coins needed.The lodge was clean and well equipped with plenty of crockery, cutlery etc., and although there were other properties nearby, we were not overlooked.The beds were very comfortable and the master bedroom has a tv. In the sitting room there was a good tv and DVD player. There was also nice patio furniture and a brick built barbecue. Do though take an airer to dry your swimwear and towels. In the 5 days we were there we saw lots of squirrels and deer as well as lots of birds that aren't normally found in your average garden. We even saw 3 nuthatches which was a real treat.The beautiful woodland setting is really peaceful and yet if you want activity and action, it is but a short stroll away.

groupe_3,"Last year had a lovely time at Woburn so thought would try Elveden this year.  Check in was an hr long process, a bit tough going with little ones.  Has a new executive lodge, it was nice all be it a little cosy for 5 adults and 2 little ones. It was clean and tidy but the kitchen was not well equipped and the fridge very small, the dishwasher tablet draw was broken, they did come to look at it but explained couldn't be fixed as didn't have the part but it wasn't a major issue.  We had 2 electric bikes that we had reserved and 2 bikes with toddler trailers, it was a long wait to get the bikes and to be honest we had nothing but issues with them, the first bike had a broken stand which they did promptly fix, one of the trailers had a broken suspension, the other trailer had a broken lap belt and a missing strap on one side, one bike had a broken seat and on 2 of the bikes the lights didn't work, they without hesitation exchange one of the trailers but after spending to much time trying to get the bikes in the first place we just didn't bother having the other issues looked at, we didn't want to constantly spend the little time we had at the cycle centre.  House keeping were very good and pleasant but that can't be said for all staff, some were very dismissive and made you feel like you were a nuisance.  Had lovely lake view, but spoilt by so many people fishing which meant no privacy at the back of the lodge.  It is expensive, but knew that before we left, definately book activities in advance they book up fast.  The pool was fab but parts definately need attending to, like the entrance to the rapids which is rusted.  We had asked several times if we could have our photo taken in the pool and went amd the specific photography session times, was told just to wave to the guy and he would take the photo but never saw anyone, when we tried to hunt someone down was told they and finished even though the times given said till 1pm and this was 12.40pm. Many of the lifeguards seemed as if not paying attention but the alarm that sounded for issues was a good idea and did see the lifeguards promptly attending to issues.  Glad we brought our own cot, the one provided was in a slider infested cupboard and looked damp, would have never let my child sleep in it.  All in all, we had a lovely family holiday but by no means a five star place, too many little niggles that need sorting. Hasn't put me off centre parcs but would seriously have to consider if I would come to this one again. ",1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,1.0

groupe_3,"Just came back from a weekend stay in the Waterfront Apartments at Center Parcs, Elveden. All in all, a great weekend, our room was so lovely and comfortable (not facing the water but we still loved it). Just a couple of minor negatives to mention:The subtropical paradise could do with a revamp, it was clean enough but probably needs re-painting and re-tiling soon, lacks that pristine look which I would personally expect considering the price of the weekend stay, and more so the week-long stay. Visited Hucks diner Friday night but was unfortunately kept up all night with upset stomach, pain and sickness, post-eating there. Obviously not 100% sure it was because of the food, but I remember our food arriving rather quick after ordering so that may have been something to do with it...Lastly, not a complaint as such, but in the waterside apartments there was a lot of wasted space on each floor by the lifts. Would maybe recommend putting some sofas there, plants and a vending/coffee machine of some sort, with the big windows and views there it seemed like a nice place to sit and chill.Would still go again though despite my comments!",0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,0.0,

Seen a lot of negative reviews about tired and rundown accommodation, but ours was fantastic and wildlife on your door step. Building work was going on opposite, so I can only assume ours had been updated recently because it was excellent, so we might have fell lucky.but you can't even hear the work going on,and even the contractors are really friendly .The kids have absolutely loved it, from none stop cycling around the parc (bikes a must) to the brilliant swimming pool facilities and children's activities.. Yes it can be expensive (prepare to pay upto a 3rd more than your used too on, drinks, eating out, and the shops)My wife and 3 friends went to the spa, which again was a little expensive, but they said it was brilliant.Can't believe people on here are marking it down for things like a broken wine glass and a broken light on a hire bike.

groupe_3,"We stayed at Centre Parcs Sherwood forest a few weeks back, a very enjoyable experience.  We went with our grand children and their parents who had been before, and they had some good pointers for a better visit.The first is to arrive at the right time on the Monday.  We got there around noon which was early enough to park not too far away from the main complex.  As you can't check into your cabin until 3 pm we had lunch upon our arrival and did some activities.  We went to our car at 2:30 and they let us onto the roads a few mins before 3 pm.  We also had a cabin very close to the camp centre which was great with three small kids.  Sometimes you can stay 20+ minutes away, if you have a cabin that far out it's a good idea to get bikes, which we didn't need.The best value for money is clearly the swimming area as that doesn't cost anything extra and you can have a full afternoon of fun.  Some activities seemed better value than others, so one needs to choose sensibly.  We went bowling on the Friday morning because you have to check out of your cabin by 10 am but we didn't want to leave that soon.I didn't think the restaurants were great - middling food and a little pricey.  The best value was the under-5 kids meals.  We brought food for breakfast and lunch every day, our cabin had a not bad little kitchen with just about everything we needed.  There is a decent sized supermarket on-site, a Co-op, again it wasn't the cheapest.The staff were excellent, it's a good move to essential ban visitors' cars other than during check-in and check-out, and there are certainly plenty of things to keep the whole family entertained.",0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,

groupe_3,"This was our first Center Parcs holiday and we chose to stay Monday to Friday. We've done many forest log cabin holidays, but booked Center Parcs as we hoped it would keep our young daughter busy.We stayed in an executive lodge. It was perfectly adequate, but pretty basic so would put me off ever booking anything less than executive in the future. It was clean and the kitchen was well equipped. The shower worked well. Space was a little limited - we couldn't fit the cot in the master bedroom. The bedrooms did have a strong smell of damp, and this was something that seemed to get worse as the week went on. Center Parcs seem to be aware of this as the cleaners constantly left the windows open (not ideal in October - returning to a cold cabin with a toddler wasn't great). The other thing I wasn't impressed with was the log burner fire. Whenever we have stayed in other log cabins these have always been a traditional log burner, with a safety guard around them. That's not the case at Center Parcs. The burner in our cabin couldn't have been less child friendly. This was disappointing considering Center Parcs is completely aimed at families, and something I was really surprised at. Because of this we only used it on a couple of occasions once our daughter was in bed. Our main reason for booking Center Parcs over anywhere else was for the activities available, which we hoped would entertain our toddler. The swimming available is fantastic. The baby and toddler area is a little dated and grubby looking, but with the work ongoing at the moment hopefully this will soon be rectified. We was a little disappointed in the lack of suitable activities available for our 21 month old though and did find that by the Thursday we were struggling to find things to do. We booked the football but there was only one other child booked on the activity (usually 10) so she quickly became bored, despite the staffs best efforts. The pottery painting was fantastic however. I was disappointed in the lack of facilities for toddlers. For example, the parks were great for older children, but there was only very small play areas suitable for younger ones. Soft play areas were similar, more aimed at older children. Our daughter was playing in the soft play at the Leisure Bowl when she was hit and badly cut by an older child. The area is designed for under 5's. When I approached staff they were quick to ask the older children to leave, and really it was the parents responsibility to stop their children playing in there, but this did leave a bad taste. It was particularly frustrating as this was one of the few areas for younger ones to play and it was still spoiled. We hired bikes but I am unsure whether we would do this again. Bikes cannot be taken into the village centre, so if you have a toddler that doesn't walk well this can make life a little difficult. We didn't get as much use out of them as we had hoped as we needed use of the pram. The cabin we were given was in the Pine area, which was a 20 minute walk from the village center. Next time I would choose to stay much closer.We ate out three times. Bella Italia was average but we really enjoyed our meals at Hucks and the Indian restaurant. We had the set menu at the Indian restaurant and it was best Indian meal we have had in many years. I cannot recommend it enough. It was one of the highlights of our trip.We did enjoy our time at Center Parcs, but it wasn't quite what I was expecting and I am unsure whether it is completely worthwhile until our daughter is older and can access more of the activities. It isn't a cheap holiday - having calculated our spends we could have gone abroad for less. Many things are overpriced which is very frustrating when you've already spent a lot of money on accommodation. It was a welcomed break however, spending time in the forest was wonderful and the majority of the staff we encountered were lovely.",0.0,,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,0.0,

We didn't expect much - a lakeside view was promised, as was an upgraded lodge. I seriously wouldn't recommend anyone else waste their money on this type of upgrade. Our lodge was Cedar 96. Avoid this lodge at all costs. The view is somewhat obstructed, to put it mildly. See the pictures. The lodge itself really isn't that different to a standard one. The main bedroom is a lot bigger. The bed is the same, as is the tv, which looks even smaller than it usually does because of this. It really is like a museum piece - where do they get them from ? Our lodge was a two bedroom - and both have en-suite bathrooms - one has a shower and one a hydro bath. You get a daily maid visit - not a good idea with our dog, so we told them not to bother. The television in the main living area remains utterly hopeless. Not good enough for a country where you will end up spending some time indoors. So, same old Center Parcs really. Hopeless entertainment in the accommodation, and lots of evidence of the place being constantly in use and therefore looking a bit worn out. We'll be back though - it's a place where the dog is accepted, we bring our own entertainment and often go out for the day. We view it as being like camping but without having to put up a tent. That's not very complimentary is it ? I just need to add that the Center Parcs staff were incredibly helpful after my wife contacted them about the view.

groupe_3,"Dear Centre Parcs, Thank you once again for a wonderful family holiday, this making our 4th visit &amp; 3rd in lodge 901. We have considered other uk based holidays &amp; also trying out a different centre parcs location but do like the convenience of living in Nottingham &amp; coming to Sherwood Forest. Having visited so many times we would like to offer some feedback on this occasion on a number of points. The maid service is great and having it daily is really fabulous, great cleaning and consistent standards. The toddler activities we booked including mini trek and off road explorers were fantastic. The little games included and the prize at the end was unexpected and so well thought out. Our little boy had a great time and kept talking about his adventures all week, great pictures, great memories. Staff at Bella Italia and aqua sana were amazing real customer service was notable and we were impressed. The soft play and out door play areas kept us busy for a whole week, especially the new play area behind the sports bar - that's really exciting for little ones. we found the Nature trail this time and the staff in the nature hut were so passionate and enthusiastic about nature related matters it was really lovely. So for some less positive points;The Twin room is exceptionally cold with a damp feel compared to the rest of the lodge. When fitting the bed gate the mattress felt damp. We managed the situation by keeping the heating on high &amp; opening up the radiator but clearly it's not the most economically effective long term solutionWe enjoy paying a little extra &amp; staying in a detached, quiet, well placed lodge &amp; for the 1st couple of times we visited we felt the little elemis bathroom extras were a lovely quality touch. On this visit we had the centre parcs standard bathroom essentials &amp; only in 1 of our 2 bathrooms so resulted in buying premium cost extras from parc marketWe chose to take advantage of the takeaway service on our 1st night &amp; sadly didn't make that choice again. The food we ordered was terribly bland, took 90 mins to arrive &amp; we were greeted by a deliverer/employee of Centre Parcs who claimed they didn't know where the lodge was?! More disappointingly my partners card was declined twice &amp; on a 3rd payment attempt with my card we had no issue but it left him worrying he had paid twice for the meal already. We wedged a folded up leaflet in the front door to stop it rattling in the frame in the night, as much as we love 901 we are starting to notice it's tired aspects &amp; wonder when a refurbishment is due on some of the more longstanding lodges, we've noticed there is lots of u201csprucing upu201d going on &amp; hope if we revisit this lodge it might be a little spruced.Many thanks and we would welcome your comments to the above.The Ford Family",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0

Various family members did things they wanted e.g. adult granddaughter and boyfriend had a session at aqua sana, the spa. While younger members had pedoloes, kayaks and the electric boats.

groupe_3,"As a family  we love center parcs, especially Elveden, however this recent visit has dampened my enthusiasm for it.  Accommodation was as to be expected in the basic villa, however there were problems with hot water pressure which meant a hot shower consisted of a few drops and took ages!    Wasn't the cleanest villa either.  However the facilities here are great, although the activities are overpriced and you need to book before you go as limited availability.  Do not eat in The Canopy Bar in the swimming pool  - I paid ¬£5.00 for a few flakes of tuna in an under cooked baguette.  No fizzy drinks as the gas not working and not enough staff to serve.  The biggest issue though is that my friends sons bike got stolen on the Sunday night from outside our villa, even though it was locked with an expensive D Lock.   They seem to have a problem with bike thefts - the bike cost over ¬£1,000 and he was heartbroken so has left a sour taste in our mouths.  If this is the clientele stealing bikes they must come prepared with cutting equipment, otherwise it's locals getting in and taking advantage.  Either way the safety I usually feel at Center Parcs has gone - I loved it that you could let the children have freedom but if unsavory people are getting in then I don't feel safe letting them out of my sight.   It was a good weekend up until then - CP need to step-up security to ensure this is stamped out soon....

For us, the highlights were biking all day and then cycling home in the dark; it felt like an adventure. Be prepared for the following: wasps are everywhere! You get used to them but eat inside rather than out. On departure days you will queue to get around the park and out of it. You may also need a break when you get back - it is an active holiday.

We did several activities along with hiring bikes... the meeting with owls was fab and our toddler loved it and the guy talking about them was great and knowledgeable.The little ones archery was fab and Henry was great with the kids. Our little one loved the pony ride... Yes it's only 15 mins long but probably long enough for a little one who hasn't done this before or doesn't ride regularly.... again we did the mini captains adventure as our little one likes being on boats. Hucks is fantastic for kids with the smaller height buffet... our little man felt so independent being able to look and select his food. Another fab stay cycling around and chilling in the sauna on a night... we again went to Tesco prior to coming in to Parc but had a couple of meals at restaurants also.

Also an arty craft type class that is not so geared around little ones where we felt a bit left out/looked at. So not the lady taking the groups fault. It's just about inclusion.

groupe_3,"We stayed in lodge 554 Maple which was a few minutes walk away from the village so was perfect. The villa was OK, tired in places but was fine as a base for us as a family. A tip, take spare toilet rolls, dishwasher tablets, washing up liquid and bin liners! You get given a small amount of items but it's not enough to see you through. You are not given enough for a 4 night break if you are a family of 5 like us. The on-site supermarket is very expensive (carrier bag charge 15p) but Sainsbury's and Lidl 10 minutes away. When I woke up after my first nights sleep I kept hearing really loud planes and then it dawned on me we were very close to RAF Lakenheath and every morning quite early and during the day the jets fly over the resort which can be really off putting. If I had known that beforehand I would of gone to Woburn instead. It was a shame.  The swimming pool, take your own towels, you have to pay for these to hire them out ¬£2 a go! The whirl pools and hot tub look very tired and could do with a refurb. I wasn't impressed with the hot tub, it had no bubbles at all. Apart from that everything else was fab, we all had a good time, eating out is expensive which you would expect, activities are great, you must book well in advance for the good ones. Another tip! Hire a bike! The forest is a big place. You can keep it cheap, the parks are fab for the kids, the pool, there are cheaper activities for the little ones, there is football golf and football pool which is fun, the electric boat and pedallos, roller disco.

The accommodation was good, but the mattress was very uncomfortable - also the beds had heavy duvets on when the temperature was 16 degrees - no sheet/blanket option provided. Showers were on the light side - but probably for water conservation, but overall more than adequate.We ate out most days, the staff were always polite and helpful, Hucks was really overpriced for the portion size / content of the meal. Cafe Rouge had 2 main courses unavailable and no alternatives - this was at 7pm - so very limited menu. Bella Italia was fantastic, huge menu, great food and good portion size for a reasonable price.The sports bar was great for brunch or a sandwich.The sports facilities are excellent and access to them was very good.The dome seemed very crowded now - a lot of seating areas have been converted to cabanas and for the raft slide arrival area, the pool was good and when the new additions have been made it will be interesting to see what effect this has on the dome.We used the Aqua Sana, looks great - the cost was higher than last time, but they have got rid of over half of the experiences, there are now 3 large saunas??? Loads of beds for relaxing - almost the whole upper floor + 2 rooms on the ground floor, which were empty + an outside lodge which was nearly empty, looks great but not very impressed - we used to do spa days, but there isn't enough variety now to spend longer than 3 hours.On the whole a good holiday, but I don't think we will be returning to Sherwood any time soon.",0.0,,1.0,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

groupe_3,"Our 4th visit to Center Parcs. This time we went back to Sherwood, which we find is the best of the 3 we've done (others are Elvedon and Woburn) as it has the most mature forest location so wildlife is very interesting and entertaining around the lodge. The lodge had a sauna which we made use of and is an interesting relaxing experience if you never tried it. So we didn't bother with the Aqua Sana which have done in the past (also good though).The 3 bed lodge was spacious and had everything we needed. Perhaps it could be cleaned a little bit better but I'm not saying this to put the cleaning staff down. I appreciate it is a mammoth task cleaning all these lodges on the change over days to the current level already. The wildlife around the lodge is always fun to watch and it is recommended to buy some badger and/or bird food at the on site supermarket to interact with these. Countless squirrels, rabbits, birds, ducks, geese and even a little hedgehog came for a visit near our lodge during our stay.The staff couldn't have been better during our visit all around to be honest. We ate at Cafe Rouge, Forester Inn, The Pancake House and had snacks in the Leisure Bowl and the two Starbucks on site. All staff at these places were friendly, efficient, competent and just great people.In addition to some bowling, we did the pottery painting (our 4th time) and that is always great fun. Also had a go on a pedal boat and of course swam every day at the pool complex. The new slide that will open next year will be a great addition. The rapids at Sherwood are probably the best out of the 3 Center Parcs we've done but also the most dangerous! :-) The two small slides seem a bit tame but if you lie flat you can get some crazy speeds going eventually.Special mention for the lovely girl with the horse and carriage who made it a great experience trotting around the park for a bit behind her horse Rolex. And last but certainly not least: the great woman at the cupcake decorating session. (Definitely recommended experience!). I was so surprised all 3 of us managed to decorate cupcakes relatively close to the beautiful examples shown. That activity seemed a little pricey at first but when I saw what we got out of it, the materials provided and constant attention from the staff it really is a bargain. I was very happy I prebooked it. There is tonnes of other stuff to do but everything we have tried this time and in the past is always well worth the price you pay in my opinion.It felt like I'd left the UK and really was somewhere else this time, partly probably because we had some great weather during our late September visit.I'd say it's somewhat unlikely you'd get such a good service from staff in places abroad (going by my experiences at least).A staycation really isn't a bad choice!Visiting Center Parcs and enjoying the things it has to offer is one of the best things you can do with your precious free time in the UK for sure.We will be back.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,1.0

groupe_3,"We visited Sherwood after 2 years at Whinfell Forest. Our last visit to Sherwood was some 20 years ago, and it seems the accommodation has hardly (if at all) been touched ! Things were broken or didn't work - to be fair we reported these to Guest Services and they were rectified pretty quickly - but the overall cleanliness and maintenance of the lodges was very poor.  There were 3 families in two Woodland Lodges, we all agreed that they could do with a proper clean instead of a 'wipe over' , the pillow cases were so thin almost transparent, appliances were old and inadequate - the cooker/grill didn't work properly, the dishwasher top shelf almost fell out a number of times. Very difficult when trying to cater for 2 families.   Lights outside didn't work, the overall impression was not good.  We felt that CP need to pay a little more attention to the maintenance and cleaning of the existing lodges as well as building new ones. Considering these holidays are not cheap, CP need to make sure that they are at least well maintained to a reasonable standard.  We felt they were bordering on shoddy.  There is work being done on the tropical swimming pool, so part of it was shut off which we knew about, but it was hardly a sub tropical temperature though, getting out of the water was quite a cold experience even in the cabana we booked.   Again, in comparison to Whinfell we didn't enjoy as much as we expected.    On the plus side, staff were really helpful and very nice.  We had to send a meal back because it was cold in the Forresters - this was refunded without us even asking so customer service there was very good !  Overall we enjoyed our stay as we were a family all together ranging in age from 2 to 70, the activities were good, and like you do, we made the best of everything.

groupe_3,"Every year my big crazy family and I go to the Centre Parcs in Elveden Forest, and every time we have the best weekend of our year. The past two years we have stayed in the large villas that sleep 8, and we rent 2 of them to sleep our very large family and my grandmother and uncle stay in the hotel on site. While I have only joined on the trip the past 4 years, my family have been doing for over 10 years now. But the reason why I have decided to write a review this time is because I recently just returned from the trip yesterday and it was the best year yet because of one special staff member in particular, and his name is Mr Steve Brikley. Steve is one of the supervisors on the booking desk at which you book activities, which we do each year, and this year my cousins, sister and I decided to do the 'The Drop' activity, which I did last year, but I couldn't decide on an activity for this year so I wanted to do it again, however, due to human error that my sister and I were quite agitated at the time by, a member of staff had double booked us, and after we spoke with different members of staff we eventually spoke to Steve, which at first site was very helpful and understanding, and in the end refunded me, my sister and 2 cousins for the activity we paid for and then because we only wanted to do the activity with my cousins, he booked me and my sister for a complimentary spa treatment which made our trip. But it wasn't just that that made our trip, it was because of how helpful he was and it just shows that a good attitude to people and understand them can make a great difference. Overall, if you are reading this and have never been to any centre parcs site before, each time we have been, we have always had the best time, from swimming down the rapids and screaming our lungs out on the cyclone, to riding bikes all around the forest many times over and spending quality family time together doing various activities all weekend, we always enjoy every second of it, and I can almost guarantee you will feel the same after just a short weekend of it.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,0.0,,0.0,

groupe_3,"Our first visit for several years; and having not been here since the children were much younger we were curious as to how things would work out - we shouldn't have worried; it was great.Our accommodation (a 2 bed exclusive lodge i think) was fine; externally it was a bit tired but inside was fine for our needs for a short break; it was clean and reasonably well equipped.  It is worth noting as well that the design is such that while you are very close to the lodges either side, you cannot actually see them from your lodge and do have unbroken views of the woods which is lovely.  The lodge was in the Maple area which was very convenient for getting to the centre of the park.We had booked a couple of activities in advance (High ropes and the Drop) and booked others like badminton, tennis and boating on the day - all very easy and efficient.  The activities were excellent and i would highlight that the young staff (many of whom seemed to be Gap Year students) were great - unfailingly enthusiastic and helpful.  In fact; i would make the same comment about all the staff we dealt with during our stay; including those in the restaurants - all very courteous, professional and helpful.  The staff in the cycle centre were particularly helpful when i turned up with a puncture on my bike (personal bike that i had brought with me, not a hire bike) on the Sunday morning - i was given a courtesy bike while this was fixed and returned in an hour or so with a new tube fitted and no charge.  Service over and above what i had expected (thanks Owen).We ate in Hucks, Cafe Rouge, Bella Italia and the Foresters Inn while we were there and had the takeaway service one evening.  The food in all the restaurants was ok (Hucks and Cafe Rouge were actually better than expected), but the kitchen seemed to be struggling to cope at Foresters Inn and Cafe Rouge - neither appeared particularly busy but at both we were warned there would be a bit of wait as the kitchens were so busy; my impression was just that they they did not have sufficient staff working - looking at previous comments this seems to be recurrent theme.The only negative during our stay was that one of our bikes was stolen from outside the lodge on our last night - it was locked securely but the chain was simply cut and the bike taken (three others were left).  Security staff appeared promptly when called and did what they could but it obviously left a bit of a cloud hanging over what was a great long weekend.We are thinking about when we will return though and would have no hesitation recommending Elveden Forest.",1.0,1.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0

We originally chose it as a place where the girls could learn to cycle safely. 7 years on, it is a familiar setting which they can navigate confidently and independently so we can share experiences and build memories without being joined at the hip.

It was ok - we had a good visit but it was just too busy for us.The lodge was fine - clean and adequate for our needs. We had booked our activities in advance which was lucky. Activities were enjoyable although the aerial adventure was very disorganised on arrival. It is not made clear where you check in and as a result there were a lot of queues and milling around. This seemed to sum up most activities which is very different to the other centres. Visited Cafe Rouge, Rajinda and Pancake House. Can't fault them especially Rajinda. Downside to the whole visit was the need to contact security at 2.30am due to selfish people yelling and screaming and swearing about half a mile away.

Villa looked tired, stain on the rug and cobwebs on the outside patio doors.  Bathroom also could have smelt better on arrival.  Stayed in a 3 bed Woodland lodge and paid a fortune for four days. Packing up on Friday had to wait for husband to get car from car-park but because everyone else doing the same he was 10 minutes late getting back to lodge to load up and vacate. Cleaner was waiting outside my villa from 9.50 am! I felt a little intimidated by this and began to take my luggage outside to await the arrival of my husband. I obviously do understand that there has to be a check out time but to have cleaners breathing down your neck to get in to clean when we paid a small fortune is not acceptable.  Once car loaded then took us almost an hour to get back to the car-park! Disappointed with the recycling as was conscious of seperating packaging and organic matter but all ended up going in same bin. Why not compost the food waste? Restaurants very expensive for food on offer, particularly the Sports bar, ¬£4 for one slice of toast with warm beans, called it Vegan!! All in all I think our family trips to center parks are over.

We popped in before an activity booked at 1300. We walked in to be hit by an extreme stench from the males toilets which was spreading across the cafe. We were rushed to an outdoor table which was facing the children's play area, we asked if we could sit on the other side overlooking the lake to be told 'no' it's 'not open' at the moment. It was extremely sunny and lake was beautiful yet they were refusing anyone on the tables near the lake for no reason. We ordered drinks only no food, we were waiting for 40 minutes for 4 cold drinks. We were about leave as we were late for our booked activity when they arrived with no apology. We downed the milkshakes and headed in to pay, no approach from staff, I approached a female waitress who had a face like thunder and ordered 'what table'. The tables weren't numbered so I explained what we had for her to huff and sigh in my face. Ruined our afternoon and put us off. Really let the entire site down.

groupe_4,"Let's be clear, it gets 2 stars for entertaining children. Staff are great at that. After that I just don't understand why so many people - especially without kids - are keen on it. Parents pay the bills not the children, so I don't understand why I have to live in such a regimented, timetabled environment. Otherwise it feels like a glorified motorway service station.Let's be clear the food is not even average high street fayre. When your restaurant choice is so limited, surely you make sure to offer the best. Where is Gayle's? Five Guys? Franco Manca?To make it worse, if you want a take away, you can't just go to the restaurant and order it. It has to be done through the company's central kitchen which is too small to cater for the demand. So if I want a take away, firstly I have to decide I want this at 3pm, and decide what each of us is going to eat 6 hours before my meal. And pay in advance. If I don't follow the rules, I play Russian roulette with not getting a delivery slot and may have to wait 2 hours after I've ordered. I could walk up and collect myself, for a mere 1 hour wait. To make it worse they know how many people are here at any one time, they know how many reservations have been made, courtesy of a non-refundable ¬£5 deposit. Surely they can actually estimate the number of planned take aways.So much of what there is to do, seems to have the capacity deliberately suppressed, so that profits are maximised rather than trying to offer the best possible service. Now if it cost ¬£150 to visit, fine. But it's not. At all!  Last year they made ¬£330m gross profit on a turnover of ¬£470m. And ¬£300m of that was paid in dividends to the private owners.There isn't much which you can just turn up to and have a go, instead you need to book, book, book, pay in advance and frankly are poor value.But then, the punters just keep coming.

There was no land line in our house, so we had to run down the road trying to find a land line to call Center parcs with all the problems! The house was clean in front and filthy behind. The beds are full is polyester so one sweats even on a cold evening.There is no where to dry your towels or clothes or swim suits unless you put the heating on in summer! And at night is it cold and damp in the forest.The little map one is given is so small you cannot read it and it is not detailed at all. It drives you crazy in fact. It took one week for us to get to grips with the running of the place.We were defiantly given a well over priced rate because we booked only a month before going. You are forced to pay for and eat their food unless you bring in a big enough stock of your own. Which is impossible because the fridge is too small to fit hardly anything into.The sofa is hideously uncomfortable to sit on. The TVs are super poor quality and no smart TVs. Washing is done but given back in a crinkled pile. No washing machines so it has to be done on site and yet another extra. The showers over the baths are very irritating. The hoses always twist around. The loos are very bad at flushing in the houses. Very weak flush. Highly iritating.The restaurants are very large and noisy. The swimming pool is so hot and sticky that every bacteria must grow in their. My son was very sick within 48 hours in there. If your children are under 18 you have to be here to sign up the insurance and fill in forms for every activity. So if you have booked in different activities for different aged children then you have to be in 3 places at the same time or km's apart from one another. Impossible when normal or disabled. The loos were filthy at the main tropical swimming pool. The disabled loo had not been cleaned in a very long time.The changing rooms are like a huge maze with no signs anywhere to the pool or the exit. It is like being in a hot sticky maze....The staff are very nice but a lot of young students whom have not been trained in at all and know absolutely nothing if you are lost or need to ask questions. For this price all the staff need to be trained. There are too many untrained young people.The If you are in anyway disabled I would not encourage this place at all or with young children. It is totally exhausting... not a holiday. We left more exhausted than when we went and spent double the budget because it was not clear. So be warned!! Conte parcs is a very cunning business... they rape you of every single penny and more. The magician told some very weard  jokes and had a sick sence of humour. I found this most shocking. We will not be going back.The most worrying thing is having no mobile signal and no telephones lines into the resort staff. One is compeltely cut off. It is shocking. The literature is completed out of date in the help booklets on the lodges. These need to be updated now! It tells you all the numbers you can call directly however the phones have been removed from the lodges! If I have the energy after such a exhausting week I will phone them up since we need an apology of being sold something that was not provided when we bought our holiday! Be warned. Lastly in holiday seasons the swimming pools are so over crowded and noisey it is horrific and also very dangerous if you Lisse a child or whomever you are with. It is very easy to get lost.

Firstly, half the swimming pool was closed for refurbishment (had to find out online from separate source and wasn't notified when booking was made) but improvements are desperately needed and we happened to fall on those dates. Not to worry but price never shifted or compensated for the building noise and lack of facilities.Staff are very friendly but have an air of drone like quality and were desperate to cancel activities or usher you out the door. Again it was after the summer which I imagine is busy and they probably need time off or more staff to deal with busy periods. Barman at the Forresters mentioned there were only two barmen over the busy summer months which is probably why he was ratty and was ushering us out of the bar at 9 o'clock so he could get home (bar was scheduled to close at 10)Executive villa with games room (¬£1500 for four nights/¬£3000 in the summer holidays) is shabby. Games room is weak, the whole place is badly put together. Zero luxury to the place considering it wasn't cheap. I've seen reviews before mention the floorboards and thought it was just people moaning but trust me when you're trying to settle a kid or get to sleep the floor makes a terrible noise. The upstairs shower leaks into the lounge (mentioned to guest services but repairs were minimal and incorrect - I'm a plumber by trade) plus the heating didn't work downstairs. Not worth the money.Tried to book some activities but due to lack of interest (I'm interested with bank card in hand to pay over inflated prices for u201cfunu201d) these were cancelled.

groupe_4,"Our most recent addition to the family, a little girl named Georgia who is now 9 months old, put pay to any chance of a holiday in the sun this year, so with a heavy heart I reluctantly agreed to a week at Centre Parcs with the family and my wife's family. I had never been to Center Parcs before and I couldn't help but try to compare it to our last holiday the previous summer to Tenerife. My expectations were low.We decided on Elveden Forest. With us being from Sheffield and my wife's sister living in Basingstoke, it seemed an equal distance between us both. I had nothing to do with the booking, but we opted for a 4 bedroom standard lodge.I was in a bit of a grump when we arrived after spending months sat behind umpteen tractors and having my useless sat-nav take me to the wrong place. We then unloaded both cars (yes, both cars for a family of 4) and I had to take them both all the way around the lake following the sign that said u201cCar Park &amp; Exitu201d at 5mph dodging everyone on bikes. This was a bit of a pain if I'm honest. It was a half an hour job per car and I felt that they could have created other entrances to the car park than having to drive all the way around the lake. So, an hour to park 2 cars. I should add though that this does depend on where you are based in relation to the car park.AccommodationThe accommodation is pretty cosy when you have 4 adults and 4 children but nevertheless manageable. I felt that they could be better maintained. We had numerous little niggles with our lodge including a tap that was like a pressure washer (bit broken off the end), toilet that constantly leaked, no soft door closures on any kitchen cupboards which is really annoying when you have people sleeping, curtains were next to uselessu2026. These are all little niggles though and not anything that had a negative effect on our holiday u2013 I just think they could maintain the accommodation a bit better, especially given the price which we all know is expensive.Entertainment &amp; AmenitiesWe really enjoyed spending time at the Village Square and was there every day. Me and my son loved cycling there in a morning and parking up the bikes while my wife followed with our daughter in her pushchair. Here you will find the Subtropical Swimming Paradise, Supermarket, Sports Plaza, numerous restaurants, caf√©'s, the Sports Bar and more. There are plenty of things for kids to do while adults relax. A stone's throw away from the Village Square was the beach which was a nice spot to chill although it's a bit disappointing that kids weren't allowed to go in the water, I suspect due to the huge carp that were in there! There's also several outdoor playgrounds for younger and older children to play. Everything feels totally safe.ActivitiesWe had pre-booked a few activities to get us into the swing of things but booked the rest while we were there and knew what time we had available. Every single one was fantastic and I felt reasonable value for money. All of the Center Parcs staff that looked after us were amazing and very enthusiastic. They genuinely looked like they enjoyed their jobs. It was really convenient to book activities using the Center Parcs iPhone app or their website and pay by credit card. We did however encounter one issue where a Badminton court was available but the app showed that there was no equipment available to hire for that specific time slot. I spoke to the booking desk and they said it was an error on the website. There are so many things to do that we could have easily spent another week there and not been bored.Swimming PoolWe spent every day here. Both my 8 year old son and 8 month old daughter absolutely loved it and there was plenty to entertain them both. The facilities were excellent. It was cool having a Starbucks inside and being able to buy a coffee using my Apple Watch! The rides were brilliant. The 4 person one was probably the best but we only went on this once as the queues were quite long (half an hour). The rapids were great and we went round and round on them for hours. Also the Venture Cove was great to be able to let my eldest run loose while we played with our 8 month old in the kiddies section.Food &amp; DrinkWe ate out most of the time but did have a few evenings eating in our lodge. We felt the food was a tad expensive compared to what you might pay at similar places outside of Center Parcs but it wasn't ridiculous. What we did appreciate was the play facilities for kids in most restaurants. It was nice to be able to send your kids off to play in between courses with having to entertain them. Drink is very expensive. I think the cost of alcohol has become ridiculous really and just a money spinner. ¬£4.50 for a pint of Carlingu2026 WHAT?! There's a decent selection though to be fair. In the Foresters, which is a pub next to the Spa, it's even worse. ¬£13.50 for a full English breakfast and our round of a single G&amp;T and small house wine came to over ¬£15!!! Come on CP u2013 this is ridiculous and you know it is. Lower the prices and you might get more paying customers. It's even ¬£2 for a game of pool for goodness sake!Overall, I was massively impressed with our week at Elveden Forest and I wouldn't hesitate going back there again, although I'd prefer this as a week in Spring/Autumn/Winter as you can't beat a holiday abroad in Summer in my opinion. There were a few niggles, as you would expect anywhere, and it is expensive but not enough to rate it any less than 5 stars. I love the whole ethos of ditching your car and getting around on bikes and to be honest it does feel like you're on holiday. Apart from the weather it's easy to forget where you are and feel like you're in another country. Having only been to one I can't compare it to any other Center Parcs locations but I'll certainly be visiting our local one at Sherwood Forest in the future.

How any house keeper can leave it in such a state is beyond a joke. The double bed felt as if it had been stuffed to fill in the holes, and the windows in the whole room were filthy.The floor mat they provide for when you come out of the shower, was black from the filthy floor after one shower. I left it in the bath to be changed, but when we came back, they had hung it on the towel rail....lovely for the people who hang their clean towels on there. This is absolutely disgusting. Who does that? I'm quite happy to pay top prices, but only when the place we are paying for is top notch, which in the past it has been. When you have been running around all day doing all the fantastic activities, you do want to relax, unfortunately we couldn't.

This time we took the extended family so ages ranged from 2 to 67 with a couple of weary parents and couple in their early 20s amongst us. I can honestly say everyone had a wonderful time. We had one of the exclusive lodges with hot tub and separate spa. Four comfortable bedroom, a huge living / kitchen space and separate games room meant the seven residents could spread out but also be comfortable all together. (And spreading the cost amongst seven meant it wasn't any more expensive than some of the smaller accommodation is).As always we spent plenty of time in the pool, visiting the restaurants etc. We were especially impressed with the Nature Centre and (perhaps being the first time with a toddler) the parc market and the way our daughter was treated and engaged with. We also sought out the soft play and various play areas (which we have always ignored before) and enjoyed just walking around the forest seeing it all through a fresh pair of eyes! Even a day of rain didn't put a dampener on our mood.I always recommend Centre parcs because I really believe it's for everyone, all ages, whatever the budget.

My Egg salad had no dressing. The following day we went to the pancake house. The pancakes looked great and tasted yummy. Then my little boy had an accident and fell of his chair he landed on the floor and banged his head. He was so upset and screaming everyone in the resturant was looking but no member of staff bothered to ask if my little boy was ok or needed an ice pack or cool compress etc. I understand it was our fault for letting him sit on the chair but I felt upset when I left the restaurant that no one had bothered to check he was ok. We then went to the pool and asked a member of staff if they had an ice pack because we was worrying about him. The lady was lovely and really helpful. Then when we got home my boy contracted hand foot and mouth disease. Not saying its centre parks but seems highly likely.

One of the brilliant things about Center Parcs is that they seem to be constantly building and improving. Since we had been last time they had built the cyclone (water ride), redeveloped the Sports Bar (extremely well), added activities such as Segway and The Jump and upgraded some of the older style lodges.We stayed in a basic but refurbished 4 bedroom woodland lodge. There was enough room for the 8 of us and we were pleasantly surprised at how equipped the kitchen was - we managed a full Sunday roast for the 8 of us despite a shortage of oven space. All of the activities were excellent. We would highly recommend a family cabana in the pool to guarantee a large family has enough space to sit and chill together. The accommodation was good and all of the staff were very friendly. There were just 2 things that let it down. The amount of things broken and the food in the Center Parcs outlets. We saw 8 'sorry to break during your break' signs across the village on vending machines, costume dryers, body dryers and toilets. Center Parcs should certainly have words with their maintenance department. Food wise we were lucky to be self catering after a bad experience at Foresters Inn on our first evening. However we did grab lunch on our last day at the sports bar and (although we waited a long time) the food was very good. Overall, a lovely weekend and we'll certainly be back.

The accommodation was quiet, clean and tidy and beds very comfortable. Loved looking out to the forest from the living room and feeling as though we were on our own. Ducks, squirrels and Muntjac walked pass our doors. The downside was a gas oven! Terrible for cooking food. No washing machine either. Definitely need bikes as this is the easiest way to get around. So either bring your own or hire them. With the exception of Starbucks (where you know what you're getting) the food at the restaurants is average. The pancake house was below average- long waiting time for the food to come and the pancakes were stodgy. Make better ones at home. Would recommend bringing your own. Recommend the Elveden Inn which is 5min drive from the Park for Sunday Roast.We loved the activities- Cable Skiing, The Drop, Adventure Golf etc. We were booked to do Footgolf but had to cancel because of rain. They offered a 50% refund or to transfer to the next day. The activities aren't cheap and that is where they make money. That said, there is lots on offer and they are fun.Parking at check in and check out is a pain. You are allowed to take your car to the chalet to unload your gear and then you return your car to the car park. Sounds easy but it takes time to get in and out and add in picking up and dropping off bikes to make it a painful procedure.Great sport facilities and pool.

Pool area- bearing in mind it was the bank holiday weekend, it was too over crowded and it felt like there weren't enough life guards to deal with this. The rapids which are normally great fun, but this time the life guards were disinterested and not paying attention to the horrific unsafe behaviour of boy groups who were repeatedly going down in large groups, railroading their way through people, bashing them and us against the surface. My eldest son ended up with a split lip, I saw them accidentally hit a young boy in the face while with his mum, and an older man who had stopped half way along looked like he had been crushed by them.I mentioned this to the life guards and they said they will put a stop to it, but it just carried on. I really doubted their health and safety practice.The staff in general seemed uninterested.The changing rooms were disgusting- dirty floors smelled of urine, and the toilets weren't clean either.There were only two members of staff who were  kind and smiled were Sam who did my daughters hair breading and Cristine at Bella Italia.Everywhere else the staff were stern looking, no smiles, very unapproachable and it seems they have forgotten that people are overpaying to stay so at least deserve better service.I paid ¬£1000 for a 2 bedroom executive lodge without activities so one would expect better. I booked paddle boarding  for my kids and because it was raining so heavy, we turned up just on time. I paid ¬£66 for this and my three kids were the only ones doing the activity apart from two others who were kitted up to do a different water activity.

groupe_4,"An amazing weekend with friends/family. We had a lovely fully equipped (all mod cons and open fire), log cabin that could have slept up to 8 people if they brought there our sleeping bags/camping beds. The living room with kitchen area was huge and the bedrooms were also a good size. The bathroom was also modern. The whole cabin was cosy, warm and sustainably built in a large woodland area with footpaths/cycleways, so that you could walk or hire bikes to ride around and discover all the area's attractions (inc. a water park, cafes, restaurants, shops selling arts/crafts/clothing basic food items/log fuel to keep the cabin warm at night). There was an onsite spa facility with a fully qualified masseuse and beauticians who would allow you to slap treatments onto your whole bodies in a private cubicle to allow them to do their magic before washing them off in the shower facilities and enjoying a spa and/or relaxing facial. There were many more treatments on offer. The facility had an open air pool to swim in (best at night to see the twinkling stars in the pollution free environment). There are many other nature discovery, guided walks or activities in the woodland and forest, and can be booked in the reservation office, near the middle of all the dwellings (it was like a little village in a secluded forest).

You feel as if you are away from all the day to day stresses of modern life. The swimming complex is fantastic and can be enjoyed by all ages. Plenty of activities on offer. Staff are very helpful.

groupe_4,"Just returned from a fantastic break at Center Parcs Elveden. We stayed in Maple executive lodge 707 with 2 adults and 2 young kids (6 and 3). The lodge was generally clean and tidy with no major complaints - sure there is a bit of wear and tear but I think this is exaggerated in many reviews. Only minor niggles - very low water pressure on showers and plinth in kitchen kept falling off. Amenities in the lodge are home from home - including a dishwasher and tassimo coffee machine. Wi Fi is good (both in the lodge and around the site in general) - we took a Firestick to keep the kids entertained which worked well.Wildlife around the lodge is friendly and we had ducks, squirrels, rabbits and deer all come up to the patio. They can be a little intrusive but the kids loved it and after all the lodge is in a forest! Swimming was the highlight and we spent every day in the pool. This was enjoyed by all with no complaints. After a few days it does get a little boring for adults but the kids never tire! The subtropical swimming complex has enough for everyone, our favourites were the cyclone and rapids. It does get busy and if this bothers you choose your arrival times strategically - first thing at 10am or later in the afternoon tend to work well. Wet weather will always draw in crowds so  bear this in mind. Changing rooms are ok but they can get a little grotty, that said, I cannot see a practical way to keep spotless given the high turnover of people. Charging 20p for costume dryers is a bit off and counter productive for Center Parcs (surely keeping lodges dry from dripping costumes is a better option)? Away from swimming there are so many activities to do - we found these all great fun. Yes they can be expensive but walking, bike riding and spending time in the parks is just as fun and free (we took our own bikes but you can hire for a fee ).Food wise, we mainly catered in the lodge although did eat in Dexter's Kitchen and Hucks which was fine - a bit expensive but to be expected. The best option for a family is enjoying meals cooked in the lodge.In the main I'd ignore the majority of negative reviews about Elveden, - we witnessed a few guests complaining over the most trivial of things with staff tirelessly trying to resolve. This is probably due to the fact Center Parcs in quite expensive and people are looking for perfection. In summary, my observations are:- Activities are expensive and you'll need to pre-book.- Eating out for breakfast, lunch and dinner will work out very expensive. Bring your own food and snacks.- You don't need to cycle but having a bike makes the experience more fun. Don't waste money paying to stay in a lodge nearer the facilities - enjoy the walking and cycling! - Coffee and snacks in the onsite Starbucks are actually quite reasonably priced.- WiFi is good everywhere on site and in the lodges. - The on-site supermarket is about 30% more expensive for food but pretty well stocked. - You cannot please everyone and I think you get lots of fussy people visit Center Parcs. See past some of the negative reviews, overall it's a great place to visit with the family. ",0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0

We settled really quickly and quickly got to see the locals (see pictures). The children were delighted with the woodland setting and loved the play areas and swimming. The village supermarket is really well stocked and the village restaurants were fab - especially the Indian! I think there may have been a staffing issue with some of the chain restaurants which meant getting tables could be difficult. They always said the lot were full but there was lots of empty tables to be seen. We hired bikes which are great and with a child seat for our eldest. He loved it. However the service wasn't as good as it could be. We found staff didn't seem to know what they were doing but we got what we needed in the end. Just be prepared!

groupe_4,"We have been going to Center Parcs for over fifteen years, from before having children through the baby and toddler stages and now we have a 13 and 11 year old.  We usually go for a fri to mon stay and often in the October half term, so it is quite dark and cold.  I have always commented that it would be nice to spend a bit longer and to come when it is lighter and warmer and this summer it worked out well to take a full week fri to fri and we chose Elvedon - we like all the CP sites for different reasons, but picked Elvedon for this trip for a few reasons, one being the cable ski on the lake that we were keen to try.We had a two bed exec lodge and we picked our lodge in our preferred area of the park, not far from the country club in Oak - this is a great part of the village in our opinion, not too far and easy fast route to the village centre, quiet, and also has the benefits of the country club and the spa being very close.Everything was in working order in the lodge, apart from first night we got a beeping in the middle of the night and one of the kick plates at the bottom of the kitchen cupboards was adrift and meant the wine fridge door would not shut properly, so it started beeping when the temperature went adrift! husband sorted it out and no other trouble.  We did not find out a way to turn the heated towel rails on without wanging up the heating - we did not need the heating, but did want the towel rails to dry shower and pool towels for us.One of the advantages of Exec lodge over woodland lodge is the daily maid service and given we were staying a full week this time we thought this would be more useful.  We arrived around 8pm friday evening, so when we saw our maid about 10am saturday morning she said hello and asked if we wanted her today or if she would come back tomorrow.  I just assumed they would come anyway, but said they could come back tomorrow.  They came Sunday as planned.  Monday is changeover day, but we were staying on so assumed usual daily service - but we had no visit, other than a bag of new towels left on the doorstep.  We went out at 4pm and I wondered if they were just coming late given they would have prioritised getting villas ready for the new arrivals from 3pm.  Came back late and nobody had come, and we had no loo paper! Too late for the parc market so we visited guest services.  They did not apologise, did say we were due a maid, and booked us in for the service the following day (weird, as we would have been due to have it anyway?!) - she did say she would get loo roll to us - nothing came! Bit of a pain, and little thing but not the service you expect! we used tissues we had with us til we were serviced the following day and did notice the loo roll was replenished and also a spare left in the bathroom - much better idea!! We had no other maid problems, they came every day and did a great job.  It is comfortable and well equipped and spacious in your villa.  We seemed to have a crunchy plastic coating on our duvet inside the duvet cover which wasn't too comfortable, kids didn't have that and we haven't on previous visits either!We had a great week - we did sooooo many activities - we had mixed weather and it really does not matter at center parcs!  We had booked up stuff before we arrived and added some items whilst we were there - you really do have to plan head to get the best out of a center parts visit!  shame as we tried to do other things and all full, and we would have picked different days/times too on some things.  The staff that run all the activities are great, and the facilities and kit really good too.  I think the action challenge and boathouse staff are the best.We ate out our main meal every day, usually in the evening.  Most of those were booked in advance too.  Service in the restaurants is not what I am used to at restaurants near home.  The staff are very nice and very friendly and cheerful - but they are too slow and get things wrong!  The best service was at rajinda pradesh.  The worst was Bella Italia, but we waited too long and had errors in most of them really, we just went to Bella Italia twice so it felt more noticeable I suppose!!  Slowest was Forresters, where we did breakfast and waited nearly an hour for it!  and we did lunch another day there, which was ok to be long and leisurely but it often isn't with a busy schedule!Cable ski was a new activity for us - and we enjoyed that.  It took me three attempts to get up, my husband up first pull, my son up second pull, and my daughter did not really make it, but did go around lying on the board for her last pull.  They take 20 on a session and there were 16 on ours and I think we got four pulls each.  We cycled by another day and there was less than ten there so they would have got much more.  One of the problems on our session is there were around 4 wake boarding so they would go get their board on the ramp and effectively push in the queue! they certainly got lots more go's!Another new one for us was footgolf and we really enjoyed it and fitted in another round during our trip and have also investigated local golf clubs that offer it back home too.  You don't have to be any good at football (bonus for me and my daughter, who did not beat husband and son but it wasn't too bad!).It was much nicer and calmer in the weekdays vs the weekend.  It was great for us to experience both by booking a full week.Can only give this an average on value for money - a full week was ¬£2k in our two bed lodge, and we spent over ¬£1000 on all our activities, and then more to add all the food and drink.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

The accommodation was clean and well laid out and it was fun to feed the wildlife directly outside with the appropriate food which can be bought from Center Parcs own supermarket.  We had a few activities lined up but unfortunately decided to go for a cycle rather than a swim before the first activity.  I fell over, not on the bike at the time, and was fine until I tried to get up, and became aware that something was seriously wrong.  Fortunately a paramedic and nurse who were both on holiday at the time came to my aid until the Center Parc nurses arrived, my thanks to both of them and, of course the, nurses who were wonderful. My cousin drove me to the nearest hospital and afterwards, leg in brace, xrays taken and sent digitally to my home hospital, we returned to the lodge.  It was a Saturday, there was no point in going home, not only was it the weekend, but it gave me time to get over the shock before the long drive home to southern england, so we decided to use the remainder of our stay.  Of course I was housebound but there are worse places to stay in!  When we returned from the hospital to the Parc staff drove us back to the lodge once my cousin had parked her car.  That evening we turned the TV on which wouldn't work, it was about ten in the evening so my cousin phoned housekeeping, not expecting any action, but someone turned up and cheerfully put it right for us.  All the staff were upbeat and helpful throughout our stay, with the exception of a member of the cycle hire staff, who demanded that my cousin take me to him in a wheelchair to prove that I had fractured my kneecap before he would refund the hire fee of the bicycle.  However this was sorted out eventually, although perhaps better communication within the Parc could be implemented.   But I would particularly like to thank the cleaner, who on the day of departure, saw me struggling on newly acquired crutches to reach the car which was a little distance from the lodge, but seemed miles to me!  She dropped everything to help me.  She wasn't cleaning our lodge and I had my back to her, she could have chosen to ignore me but she didn't - her help was invaluable and I only wish I had asked her name.  She was near lodge 683 on 2nd September around 10am. I only hope she reads this - thanks again!  I would certainly like to return to Sherwood again (not cycling this time!)

groupe_4,"We're just back to reality after a lovely week's break at CP Sherwood.  We've been several times before, staying in the woodland lodges, which have a lovely charm - but this time we decided to splash out a little more and stay in one of the executive apartments - (on the map it's marked as ASH, but the building is called Clumber). We paid the extra ¬£35 to have early arrival - meant to be 2pm rather than 3pm.  However, as we always do, we turned up early with the idea of parking up outside the lodge (which they allow for the day of arrival to unload), and grab some lunch whilst waiting.  Given the time was 12:30 we didn't expect to be let in.After being shown directions to the lodge, and finding out that it had it's own dedicated parking space, we drove round, found the space (which was immediately outside the apartments) and parked up. Being nosey, we went for a look, ran into the housekeeper (a lovely woman called Wendy) who said that she knew we were coming early and did we want to take a peek? Of course we did!The apartment was HUGE - the front room alone was the same size as the entire woodland lodge we'd had before! The bedroom was just as big, with a lovely double bed and large sliding doors in both.  The bathroom was spotless, double sink and a whirlpool bath completing the picture.Once we'd had a look around, we snook our bags in - after all, we had the keys so why not ;-). Once settled, we took a walk down to the cycle hire centre and picked our bikes up,  then off to the Jardin Des Sports for lunch.In terms of facitities:The Village is nice, with a good sized, well priced supermarket (which now prices matches to major chains to ensure value for money rather than preying on a captive audience), several gift type shops, a Starbucks and several restaurants.  This is also where the entrance to the sub-tropical pool area is.  The Pool: the pool was as lovely as ever, even with the building works going on around it. When they're finished, it will be stunning, with a new children's play area and a 2nd water ride (apparently more thrilling than the current tame version).  The building works didnt detract from our enjoyment one bit.Further afield, there is the Country Club, which does lovely luxury hot chocolate, which can be enjoyed whilst viewing the lake, the Waffle House next to the boating area, 2 golfing areas (one a mini putting green, the other an adventure golf area), an activity centre which allows for 'go ape' style rope walks through the trees, archery, quad biking and pony treks.A lot is always said about the cost of Center Parcs - but to be honest? A great week can be had pretty cheaply if you think about the time you want to spend out of the pool and lodge - we only hired bikes and booked a few activities, but we don't have children - I'm sure that with some imagination activities that don't cost the earth can be found (we encountered one family who made their own treasure hunt through the woods).I can't recommend CP:Sherwood enough, it's a brilliant place to unwind and enjoy our wonderful nature.",0.0,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,1.0

The carpets were filthy, it had an awful odour. Quite frankly depressing. I could not use one bedroom. The lodge next door had at least 3 Asian families staying in it. Not sure if that would fit the criteria for health and safety. However they were quiet and pleasant people. I thought maybe Elverton might be better. I paid extra for a refurbished room! Again not a cheap deal. It stank of mould spurs. There was an awful musty smell. My young child suffers from a very bad  chest. I asked to change to a different cabin and they said someone would come out to check for damp the following day. They would use chemicals to get rid of the damp. I left early.

groupe_4,We have been coming to Center Parcs at least once or twice a year for over 15 years. We have seen the continued building of additional houses/lodges over the years without any real new provision to cope. The result on both Sherwood &amp; Winfell is that you feel more and more overrun. The latest CP advert makes us laugh given the family appear to be in the clear woodland and don't come across anyone else - a very rare occurrence. If CP need more lodges then build another park rather than continuing to sandwich more &amp; more guests into the existing ones.

groupe_4,"My family or four (2 adults, a three year old and three month old baby) and I have just returned from a Mon - Fri break and could not recommend this whole experience highly enough!Check in on the Monday was seamless, we arrived just before 3pm which is the busiest time to arrive and we flew through with no issues, car park and complex easy to navigate and we found our lodge quickly. The lodge (Oak 541) was spotless and lovely, we were really impressed as we had booked just the standard 2 bed woodland lodge and couldn't have asked for better! The location which we didn't pay extra to chose and left to chance was also in a great place and even with a theee year old walking only took about 10 mins to get to all the main activities! The activities I felt were more than fairly priced and I struggle to understand why people find these expensive (maybe they have only partaken at Center Parcs and so have no comparison) my three year old did the Captains adventure on the lake and the mini trek. Both were well run and immensely enjoyable for her, the team are also very accommodating for the parents not booked on with the children but who wanted to get close to take pictures and share some fun which was really appreciated! Both included prizes at the end which were unexpected, added to her fun and made them seem better value for money!The restaurants were also fairly priced when compared to everyday restaurants we ate out several times during our stay, the highlights were Hucks which was delicious for food, my husband had a HUGE platter for ¬£19.95 and I had a couple starters for mains (all between ¬£5 -  ¬£7) again standard pricing! The kids buffet was fantastic for ¬£8 my three year old loved it and being able to pick and chose her favourites herself was a novelty worth paying for! Drinks a four pint pitcher for ¬£15 and two cocktails for ¬£12 is fantastic!!!! Also the sports cafe was great, really relaxed atmosphere, perfect seating for families which allows you to watch your children playing but still enjoy a rest at your table, plenty for little ones to do with a soft play area, outdoor play and arcade type rides and games. They also have many food offers to keep eating out costs down over each meal. We chose three small plates for ¬£15, they were so delicious and BIG even my husband struggled to finish and at ¬£5 a plate it was SUCH good value! We took food with us as we were worried about market prices - we shouldn't have been, general items were about the same as a supermarket, only the special items such as the logs for the lodge fire and grab and go soft drinks were more like service station price so next time I would save the car space and wait until arrival.The team across the complex are fantastic and go above and beyond to make sure your stay is comfortable and you are having a great time, all were good with the children and seemed to have patience and time for everyone no matter how busy!The pool is amazing even though they are renovating for next summer this is not intrusive or makes an impact on current breaks. I was slightly worried there would not be much my three year old could go on but I couldn't have been more wrong, apart from the rapids (for obvious reasons) she could ride all the slides and loved doing so! There was also a lovely warm pool so my theee month old baby could happily bob around in his ring without me worrying he was too cold etc! There was plenty of free things to do if money is tight, lots of outdoor play areas, the pool, soft play indoor areas and a fantastic children's disco in the leisure bowl from 6-9 we had to drag my three year old way from! All in all this break could not have been better or more enjoyed, if you are used to all inclusive bargain breaks then yes this will seem more expensive but when you look at what you are getting compared to at home there is not much difference and this is all really well run and special!

We said we was willing to wait so in the end we were able to eat there but all on separate tables which was a shame and would have been avoided if we could have booked well in advance as we did with Hucks.

Stayed in a new woodland 2 bed, 197, which we preferred to the exec cabin we stayed in last year as the location is very close to the village square.

Our 3 year old had a huge variety of playgrounds, soft play and swimming areas  to fill her days without having to spend lots of money. However we did book her in to the cr√®che for two afternoons while we went to the spa. One afternoon was Mad Hatters tea party and the other was chocolate academy- both fantastic!! We would highly recommend the cr√®che, which was safe and professional with brilliant and well planned activities. Last year we did the teddy bears picnic, another fab session, but we thought it might be a bit young for her now.We prebooked the early dining experience  menu at Hucks, ¬£19.99 each inc starter. We really enjoyed this, particularly the starter platter. We asked to sit near to the soft play area so our daughter could go off and play in our sight.We did just get the standard menu at Hucks another evening which wasn't as good and a bit pricey.There is an offer for a spa session at ¬£26 when you book the cr√®che, we thought this was reasonable value as the spa is lovely. We will be booking again for early 2019 as our daughter loves it so much. Not sure whether we will continue to visit when she is older as the activities for older kids would be very expensive.

groupe_4,"This was our first time visiting Sherwood (we'd previously stayed at Whinfell) and we stayed for a long weekend in a 2 bedroom executive lodge in the Pine area. The lodge was spotlessly clean and we had daily cleaning service which meant it stayed that way. Each bedroom had an en suite - one with a bath with shower above and the other with shower which meant no queuing for the bathroom. There was everything we needed in the kitchen for times we wanted to eat in. As Pine is on the edge we'd taken our bikes to get around which was essential to avoid our 4 year old complaining of tired legs but we really enjoyed cycling around everywhere and getting fresh air. Our four year old loved spotting all the wildlife that was walking/running around. The outdoor activities at Sherwood were great and we were lucky enough to have a sunny weekend. They aren't cheap but we already expected that and it was about being able to experience things that our four year old wouldn't normally have the chance to do all in one place. We also did crazy science which she loved. The pool was good (although we preferred Whinfell if choosing between different centre parcs as there was more to do there). There was a great family ride that we really enjoyed and a few other smaller rides (2 that our four year old could go on on her own) as well as the wave pool and outdoor pool. We spent just under 2 hours there each day. They are building some new rides for 2019 too. Changing rooms were fine, there were limited numbers of family changing rooms so we did squeeze into smaller ones but we always found somewhere. There were plenty of food options if you wanted to eat out though they are expensive. We really enjoyed Bella Italia and the staff were great and child friendly but wouldn't recommend Forester's inn as we felt that was very overpriced for the quality of food.Overall we had a great family weekend away, our four year old really enjoyed all the activities and we spent most of the weekend in the fresh air. It was expensive but we knew what we were booking so it wasn't a surprise. If comparing Sherwood and Whinfell I'd say our lodge was cleaner and more up to date at Sherwood (other than Whinfell has electronic bands that tripled up as room key/locker key/payment). The outdoor activities at Sherwood were great but we were lucky with the weather. Depending on the time of year (i.e. if not summer) I would book Whinfell if going again to ensure that there was still lots to do and largely in one place if that weather was bad.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
groupe_4,"This is the first time ever at a Centre Parcs resort. Having always thought them to be for active children type adventure park and with having an 8 year old wheelchair user, we always felt it would be an unfair break for her (however, my 6 year old was due to enjoy it for sure as she's very energetic). It was by pure chance I decided to call their customer service department to ask more detailed questions regarding their accessible facilities and I was pleasantly surprised to find out they accommodate special needs so much more than their website details.Firstly, all paths around the forest are pretty flat and well laid so wheelchairs/ prams can easily move around without difficulty. I had to check EVERY activity regarding access before booking, staff were so helpful and accommodating but not all activities were possible. The best surprise was the subtropical swimming pool, where the disabled changing rooms were massive, had a bed in it and the staff provided us with a hoist, a water wheelchair and there was a ramp down the pool, so my daughter was able to join us in the swimming fun.In the main centre (near the medical centre) there are public toilets, and one room that provided disabled loo, changing bed, ceiling hoist and shower. This room had literally made our holiday because it meant we didn't have to keep returning to our lodge whenever my daughter needed to be changed or needed the loo, so such a small facility had made a MASSIVE difference for us during our stay. The adventure golf activity was a breeze for the wheelchair and great fun for the whole family, all with a fabulous picturesque scenery backdrop. We really wanted to take a boat out and although a wheelchair can get all the way down to the boats, it would require the wheelchair user to transfer onto the seat but without a hoist, that was not possible for my daughter.We also managed to book both children in to the Pirates and Princess Adventure (the creche area) where the staff had planned for an extra member of staff to stay with my daughter and aid her where needed during the 3 hours there. They were FABULOUS! And we managed a couple of spa treatments during that time. Our adapted Lodge was fantastic. Brilliant for the whole family, it had two bedrooms a master with ensuite (incl. jacuzzi bath), a twin room; one standard single bed and one electric single bed which was so comfy and nice looking (not like a hospital bed) also with adapted ensuite/wetroom. The kitchen had one lowered surface, allowing my daughter to participate in making breakfast (which she thoroughly enjoyed) and an open plan dining area and living room with double doors to a small patio outside with seating and a brick bbq. There was also a second disabled toilet/wetroom near the front door which also had a walk in shower.As a family we often struggle to find holidays/ breaks that allow us all to be involved together and having discovered how inclusive Centre Parcs Elveden is (I'm not sure about the other parcs) we will definitively be returning to it since we all loved it so much and all staff were so very good.

We chose to hire bikes in advance and it was definitely the right choice. Yes we were close to things but it was still an excuse for more exertion and we also did the treasure trail which took us to every corner of the park, helping us to get our bearings. The pool area was being worked on but we didn't feel as though we missed out on anything and the girls definitely wanted to go there every day. A BBQ (disposables only) on the first night and last night meant we had two restaurant meals. The Italian and Indian were both very nice. We did several activities both individually and together. We went out on Kayaks for 30 mins which was good fresh air. I also did the high tree top adventure ending with the zip wire across the lake, well worth it. The girls had absolutely no hesitation in doing the kids version and towards the end of our stay my wife had a massage at the spa. Yes it's quite an expensive holiday but for the fun and relaxation we had, in a very well appointed lodge with almost silent evenings despite being surrounded by other families I think it was so good that we'll definitely go again.

Its difficult to pin down what made this better than previous trips (and it wasnt the weather because that was actually quite patchy) but think we did a few different activities and they were ones which both kids could do (and us adults could join in as well). We did the little archery, off road explorers, soccer coaching and the den building. The den building in particular was good fun and the whole family enjoyed it. Its not something i have considered doing before (perhaps because of the price) but i would certainly recommend it.Other things we liked this trip included our lodge position. We were in the Maple 800s so around the northern half of the lake. This was a great spot for all the wildlife that the kids (and me) really enjoyed. We had plenty of the usual ducks, geese and squirrels but also some rabbits and a family of deer who seemed to have set up home outside our lodge. We got to feed them which my kids loved.I would also say the standard of service was better than we've experienced before. Waiters/ waitresses seemed extra friendly and helpful, the instructors at the activities were also positive and enthusiastic which made the experience all the better. We forgot our &quot;come back soon&quot; vouchers, but guest services replaced them there and then for us which i didnt expect.Lodges themselves were as clean and tidy as usual, as was the rest of the resort. My only negative would be that the cost to stay seems to be creeping up. Obviously there is inflation to consider over the last few years, but i suspect some of the activities and food prices are going up by a higher amount. Im sure It wasnt that long ago that the day pass was something like ¬£10 but now its more like ¬£40. Also the actual price of a weekend stay in a woodland lodge seems to have increased from the ¬£500 - ¬£600 range to ¬£650 - ¬£750. However, i guess if people are still willing to pay that then they will get away with charging it.Overall we loved our time here again and would be delighted to come back again. I think next time we may try one of the continental parcs if the price was right",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

We ate out every night and food was of a good standard. A few people's meals a bit hit and miss but this could happen anywhere. Activities we did included bowling, badminton, baby sensory and aerial tree trekking. Most were good value for money. We don't mind the price hikes too much as we know that's what to expect from Center Parcs however we looked into hiring a bike and trailer for ease of getting around with the baby and at a cost of ¬£84.00 for the 7 days we quickly decided against this. Bikes always seemed to be reasonably priced but now this has reached a silly point. There was no disruption to the swimming pool because of the works which was a bonus and I'm sure once it is all finished it will be amazing. We didn't have a problem finding a changing room or locker either so I think it depends on the time you go swimming maybe. Overall a great stay and we will definitely be back!

groupe_4,"We visited this Resort with the Family, renting a three bedroom Lodge, which met our needs.   On arrival, we drove up to a window and on presenting our reservation, we were provided with our Lodge Keys, a Map and a few flyers on attractions.  The roads are generally well signed, albeit a tad narrow in places and can appear very congested on arrival.  Once you locate your Lodge, you park, along with others, as close as possible and have to transfer all your bags etc as quickly as possible, as you are required to move and re-park your car, in one of the main car parks, which whilst being adequate, have a small issue, inasmuch that those leaving in the morning, have to be away from their lodge by 10.00 am, but many stay all day, to get the most of the facilities, so they re-park and therefore space can be hard to find.  Once the roads are clear, cars are replaced by Bikes, which can be rented on site.  This is fine, however the cyclists could well do in remembering that the rules of the road, still apply, so those pedestrians using the facilities, need to be respected, particularly on crossings.  There are pedestrian areas available, but many cyclists whilst we were there, just ignored them and used them as short cuts...  There are lots of things to to, with swimming pools, sports complex, children's play areas of varying skill levels, boating lake and various restaurants and shops, with even a small supermarket, for those who needed provisions.  One point to note, a lot of the activities are booked up quickly as are the Restaurants, which can be extremely frustrating especially when you walk down to get a table and are advised that they are fully booked, but the place is half empty.  A re-think is needed we believe, as several of the Restaurants were never fully occupied, we checked, so this was either a staff issue or by design and is not acceptable, in what is a semi-closed environment.   Take-Out can be booked, but again it has limited availability.   The Lodges are well appointed and maintained and the beds are comfortable, albeit a little firm for my personal taste.   The Wildlife is abundant and our grandchildren had a very enjoyable time, interacting with them, which is always fun. Overall we had a great time and would certainly return, with a little more added knowledge of how it all works and hopefully a little better prepared.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0
groupe_4,"We have just come back from a fantastic weeks break at Sherwood Forest August 20-27th.Try not to read too much into the bad reviews you'll find on this site. These people have had isolated unfortunate experiences.I have been coming to Center Parcs off and on for over 25 years first being brought by my parents and now with my own family alternating between Whinfell and Sherwood. This is the first time we have visited a Parc in the school summer holiday and after reading some of the negative reviews I was worried just how busy it would be and how the improvements to the Subtropical Paradise would affect our stay.I should not have worried! Yes, the changing rooms get busy but we ALWAYS managed to find 2 changing rooms every time we went and we went at varying times.The improvements and building works do not stop you enjoying the swimming at all! All you will see in part of the dome and a part of outside is boarding which shows pictures of the new features that will be available next summer.The pools are excellent, my son who is 6 loved them and especially loved the Rapids. We all went down them again and again and again. I thought holidays are supposed to be relaxing! :-)There are plenty of life guards so you always feel safe and they are quick to spot any people getting a bit too boisterous.The accommodation was great, when we first arrived we had a family of swans outside the front door! We stayed in an Executive lodge in the Pine area. It was spotless and housekeeping was superb with fresh towels and bedding. One thing you must know is the lack of TV channels. You don't get Freeview, there's just an odd mix of a few channels. HOWEVER there is a media hub next to the TV which has a HDMI input so you can plug in a Firestick,etc then connect to the WiFi and away you go!The kitchen has everything you need and I suggest you bring as much food as you can as eating out is VERY expensive. There is a Tesco a short drive away. The Parcmarket onsite is generally more expensive than a normal supermarket but it does have deals. It's very handy for bread, milk and eggs and it does have a bakery in store for freshly baked bread, pasties, etc.My son did plenty of activities and in all honesty some of them are not cheap. You don't have to spend on activities. There are plenty of walks, for the kids plenty of adventure playgrounds and the swimming is in with the price.I did the High Ropes Action Challenge 3 years ago at Sherwood and the new course they have there now I found disappointing. It was easier than the old one, HOWEVER there is now a 350m zip line at the end of it which takes you over the lake. FANTASTIC!The Aqua Sana is a sight to behold. It truly deserves the awards it has. Book a treatment.I'll end by saying never once during our stay did it ever feel crowded. Whether it was ordering food, getting drinks at the bar, finding a changing room, playing Adventure Golf or booking Bowling.Here are some tips:Bring in food, don't forget the ketchup and cooking oil.Bring dishwasher tablets/ washing up liquidPre book activities as early as possible to avoid disappointmentBring a firestick, Apple TV, etcBring a torchDo expect high prices to eat out/ drink out.Swimming locker take ¬£1 coinsOverall as you have gathered from reading this we had a great time.

groupe_4,"It was our first visit and my two children (ages 6 and 4) had asked for months, when are we going to Center Parcs...? Expectations were high as the Children had heard whispers on the wind in the playground and I had heard tales of it's entrancing northern european ambience. Upon arrival at the main entrance, my daughter declared she had waited her whole life for this moment. Expectations were now stratospheric. Thankfully, arrival and driving to the lodge was stress free with squirrel and rabbit spotting adding to the charm.The spacious lodge was clean albeit a little tired looking despite apparently being a &quot;new executive&quot; Sadly, there were a few issues: The fridge and the wine cooler did not work properly. The pans in the cupboard were dirty and the oven was slow to heat up.The sub tropical swimming is very good, especially for younger children with Venture Cove a particular highlight. The canopy cafe however, is grossly overpriced. Booking in advance for dinner is a Necessity. Night 1) Supper at the lodge due to being bizarrley turned away from half empty restaurants at 6pm.Night 2) Cafe Rouge serves not bad french inspired cuisine and has a decent play area which kept the children entrained between courses. The service was not very good despite the restaurant being barely half full at 6pm.Night 3) Bella Italia had a great atmosphere, exceptional service and the food was very good.What sort of people are there? It is no secret that the true middle / upper middle class moved on from the Center Parcs experience many years ago. On our weekend in early August, Elveden had a predominately upper working class / lower middle class demographic. Take this as you will.Is it expensive..?  Yes it unfortunatley is.

groupe_4,"I wouldn't recommend a one bedroom executive. The lounge area is very small with one 2 seater setter and no comfy chair. The wardrobe was minute for a 4 night stay and difficult to open as very little space between wardrobe and the bed. The bed I think was queen size and was very comfortable which gave me some extremely good night's sleep.  The kitchen was adequate but advise to open doors when cooking to avoid smoke alarm going off. Also be aware cedar 217 gets no sun on patio or lodge which in a heat wave could be a positive but we found it dark and depressing. It was advertised as having a hydrobath, which I was looking forward to as it would help my back and was gutted to find it was an ordinary bath. Apart from these issues, we had a lovely time. For those who find the restaurants a little expensive, I would recommend you have a peek over the road at the rufford country park as they have a brilliant restaurant where you can get a carvery or many more options all for around ¬£8 to ¬£9. The grounds and lake are beautiful with ruins and things for children to do. It's free to get in and just ¬£3.50 for car park although it's possible to walk.

As others have commented it was expensive, but then I was expecting this, we felt that it offered reasonable value for money.Things we liked:* The pool area was a big hit with the children of all ages. My children loved the pool the flumes and other activities. As advised though younger children need close supervision as the pool get very busy at times. * The majority of the staff were friendly and helpful. This was particularly the case with various activities we booked. * The general environment. The woods are beautiful and very appealing for both adults and children. The evenings are very peaceful, we would sit out and watch the deer in the forest.* We liked our lodge. It was only a basic one but it was very comfortable for the 6 of us and clean and well equipped.   Things we didn't like: * The welcome staff at check in - not very welcoming and a bit of a jobsworth. I didn't immediately have my booking reference to hand and she became quite impatient. * The wasps! This was a significant problem and often prevented us from sitting outside and enjoying the the good weather. My 12 year old was stung within 2 hours of arrival. I appreciate that you get wasps in August but there were dozens of the things wherever you went. They need to invest in some pest control and get rid of the nests in the park.* People reserving seats with their towels in the pool area then not using them. Come on Centre Parcs put a stop to this!  * The food in some of the restaurants sometimes being of variable quality.* Parts of the main indoor area were looking a little tired and dated, particularly the toilets.

The lodge was lovely, about a 5-10min walk from the main plaza area, situated right by a large pond and woodland.  The lodge itself was just what we needed, in good decorative order, nice, clean and with all the amenities you would expect.  After watching several blogs we knew to bring extra towels for the pool and swimming, we couldn't have BBQ's due to the hot weather but ate in the lodge at least half of the week.  We took part in the drop, quad safari, climbing, geocaching, ten pin bowling and badminton the rest of our time was spent exploring the park, swimming and playing pool.  We ate at the sports cafe, pancake house, Bella Italia, cafe rouge, Huck and Indian, we found the service the service poor at the Indian and Hucks however across all of them the food was of a good standard if not a little too pricey.  Our children enjoyed the lesuire bowl playing pool it also had a fantastic atmosphere, family friendly thatscouples could enjoy too however the ten pin bowling was less than desirable.  The parcmarket was expensive probably a M&amp;S, Waitrose level but well stocked, it had a fantastic bakery and all the essentials and more that you may need Overall I'd rate our stay here at a 7.5 out of 10 and we will be back for more fun",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0

The Sports cafe was very dirty as were the swimming pool changing areas aswell and we had never found this before after visiting centreparcs for over 10 years. We rode our bikes down to swimming on the first day and locked them all as normal but when we returned my sons bike had been taken. i visited the cycle store and was told it haf been known that ppl bring bolt cutters to cut your padlocks. we are leaving today for the first time disappointed with our holiday experience and sadly will not be returning to a place where we have had many happy memories. ,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0

groupe_4,"Myself and my partner, 9 year old step daughter and 12 week baby arrived on the Monday for what we expected to be a lovely family week away and my daughter's first holiday. I have stayed at Woburn and Elveden many times before with my parents and extended family and have never had any problems.Upon arrival our lodge was clean but there was a faint smell of damp in the main bedroom where myself and my partner and daughter would sleep, we opened the windows and this seemed to get slightly better. We then decided to put up the travel cot provided to make sure my daughter's bed was ready however it was a cheap travel cot and the base was firm wood with the thinnest padding and there was no additional matress provided so we decided it would be best for her to sleep in her pram bassinet over night for the week. Over the next day or so the damp smell had got worse and worse which has resulted in my daughter sleeping in her pram in the living room and me sleeping on the sofa as I suffer from asthma - really not what I expected or have ever experienced from Center Parcs. We actually packed up to go home on the wednesday morning but my step daughter looked so disappointed that we decided we should stay for her.For the thursday I pre booked a cabana for the family as I thought this would be perfect with having a 12 week old - she could keep warm and sleep if needed, but no. It was freezing and half way through sitting in the cabana all we could smell were paint fumes, it was so strong. Luckily the person working on the pool today has offered us a refund because it was so bad but this shouldn't happen.u00a0I've been left so disappointed as I've had so many great breaks at centre parcs but can certainly say we won't be returning, especially with the way this matter has been delt with both at sherwood and head office. Three people came and checked the damp, two said they would usually spray the room (yes, really!) but wouldn't on this occasion because of my asthma and one said the moisture reading on the walls shouldn't be above 2.5 but ours was 4.6....but it was just left at that until the next morning the manager on site came to inspect and as expected tried to treat us like idiots saying the moisture reader from the night before had not been used correctly and the smell he could smell wasn't damp....although agreed the matress was damp!? When he realised we weren't thick and weren't going to be convinced by what he was saying he couldnt get away quick enough. Initially from head office I was offered discount off a future visit but there is no way I would step foot in any of these places again so I was given a partial refund (bit of an insult but better than nothing). I was asked why I didn't report it earlier in the week but had already been informed that they were fully booked and no other accommodation was available. For the money we have paid it's not what I would expect. Fortunately we have other holidays to look forward to this year but I feel sad for the people who don't and have also worked hard to pay the premium center parcs prices expecting a premium break away. Hopefully this review will help other people so that no one else has to experience the same problems when they have spent a significant amount of money. It's clear the person looking after this center parcs site has no children or compassion for the people staying in these damp, smelly, old lodges and it's clear they are in complete denial with the responses on here. Save your money and book a caravan somewhere as that's what it felt like we were in. Also please be aware the 'new' lodges are only a partial refurb of the old ones.

Best to hire bikes or take your own as I did, makes traveling between places and activities a whole lot easier, although when busy people don't tend to understand where to walk or cycle (wrong side of the road mostly or just plain dense walking down the middle of the cycle paths without a care in the world! But who am I to judge? They're on holiday too haha)The accommodation was ok, not facing onto a lake like we have had in previous years but as a base for us all it was more than adequate albeit a little dated now, but we do visit regularly so to a newcomer the accommodation would look great! Location wise everything is easily accessible by bike or walking and there is plenty for all to do!Staff wise, not a single complaint about any of the ones we dealt with, more than happy to help or assist, Katie in the nature centre behind the country club was excellent with my 10 year old whilst we wove willow, there was also the two young ladies who were manning the climbing wall in the u201cJardin Des Sportsu201d who helped with my eldest daughters fears too! Now the down side which is such a shame:.. HOW MUCH?! .. you'll find yourself saying to yourself quite a lot, we have come to expect it as we do love the place but it has gotten a bit out of hand now with the hikes in prices, bottle of beer in the sports bar you are looking at town prices at ¬£5.50 a go! Food prices in the restaurants are quite ridiculous too, we have turned to bringing our own food to cook in the lodge, we would eat out from Starbucks or the Parc Mart at lunch but point blank refuse to pay for eating out at any of the on site restaurants.Apart from the prices of activities and food, we love Center Parcs, we may try one of the other ones though just for a change of scenery!Word of advice too... don't leave your food in the oven to cook either whilst you go off out!

Cafe rouge was quite busy and service was a little slow both with drinks and the food, but they were exceptionally busy. There are many activities and one thing I would recommend is to plan and book these. During our stay I wanted to go boating as we had done this the previous year and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately it was fully booked when I enquired but this was my fault for not booking in advance. The crazy golf was really enjoyable and whilst this was only 9 holes it's a really fun and enjoyable course.

I mean really, really rammed. Best time to go is around 7pm. Its also a bit manky. Keep your flip flops on if you value your hygiene.Best place to eat: Cafe Rouge or The Sports Cafe. Opt for the half portions at half the price, still very satisfying.Take your own sports equipment with you but be prepared to pay ¬£10 for 45 mins of badmington (costs ¬£7 at my local sports centre), ¬£11 for 60 mins for a tennis court (¬£5 locally for us) and ¬£6.50 for 60 mins of ping pong!

Emma as field archery was brilliant fun and took a shine to our son 'Skippy', and Dave/Seb was very helpful with laser target shooting with my pitiful attempts.  Laser tag in sweltering heat was hard work and I would recommend they have more water nearby.  Didn't do as many activities in the sports plaza this time as it was just too hot.

It felt much smaller than other Center Parcs lodges we've stayed in, and the layout was poor. The kitchen was also a corridor to the kids' bedroom (who thought this was a good idea?!), which is inconvenient, annoying and more than a little dangerous.I also felt the lodge was a bit scrappy and in need of redecoration and a bit of TLC.

Room was large and well equipped from the bedroom/lounge area to the kitchen.  Beds comfy and bed guard provided free of charge.  Kitchen had everything you needed and more.  Showroom was also large and well equipped.

Just took couple of times to find the quickest route as as others have said, signage can be confusing.Facilities- used the beach, which was clean and being raked early in the morning.  The pool yes it can get busy, but always found buggy space, a locker a chair or 2, a shower and a hairdryer.  Only had to wait once for a family change room.  Used all areas of the pool except the flumes/rides.  Staff are good and quickly cleared the pool when it needed to be attended to which shows a focus on hygiene.

And paying ¬£600 for 4 nights you may expect a little bit more luxary, even with a dog. It's awful, NOTHING about the villa screams luxary. The fact that you have to bring your own loo roll says it all. The outside of our villa was awful, thorns and mud everywhere. There was a tiny patch for me to walk our dog. Which brings me into another area, this park is NOT dog friendly. From what I saw there we're 2 dog u201cexerciseu201d areas which were probably no more than 30x30 meters. It was a disgrace, obviously dogs must be on a lead through out walking the park but giving them that much of free roaming is rediculous. Also I find the prices to be absolutely unbelievable. How on earth can you justify paying ¬£25 for a child to decorate some cupcakes? That blew my mind with how much this company cares about making money and so little about it's customers.

Staff are far from helpful, although to their credit check in staff were very helpful and friendly when we got there and that side of things wasn't an issue, it's just throughout the park there seems to be no WOW factor or staff that actually care about giving their guests a good time.

groupe_5,"Just returned from a 7 night stay at Elveden end of July &amp; can't recommend this CP enough. Have stayed at other CP in the past but not for some years &amp; this experience shows they have modernised &amp; developed massivelyFamily group of 6 of all age ranges between 17-64. Booked a New Woodland Lodge in Birch area middle area on map - perfect distance for our group, I always prefer not to be too near the centre so more peaceful &amp; this was ideal at approx 15 minute walk from the centre. This worked well for us, even with a member of our party having a disability Elveden is very flat so not difficult to walk roundLodge was fab, spotlessly clean. Few little extras I hadn't expected such as a Bosch coffee maker ( the type that takes the pods), cloth/tea towel/ dishwasher tabs etc to get you started in the kitchen - small selection of complimentary toiletries in bathroom. Also a safe which was useful for storing valuables when out. Second toilet in hallway in addition to main bathroom. Loved the chalk board in kitchen with a lovely welcome message on it on our arrival . Kitchen well equipped &amp; everything in lodge in good working order. Would recommend bringing some sharp knives from Home plus larger casserole dishes if cooking meals for 6 as only one provided which was quite small. Would also bring my own frying pan next time as one supplied was not non stick so difficult to cook withFridge is the small under counter type with an internal ice box so slightly tricky fitting everything in if you plan to eat mainly at lodge for 6 people as we did. We did a big Sainsbury's shop at the store 5 minutes away before arriving which catered for most things but did have to top up from on site Parcmarket during stay . As people have stated this is a bit pricier although can vary depending what you buy. Bottles wine at ¬£7 which isn't massively more than at home Weather was beautiful as mid UK heatwave so spent lots of time on patio enjoying outdoors &amp; wildlife. Visited regularly by deer, squirrels &amp; birds. Quite a few flies &amp; wasps etc but living in the forest this comes with the territory Eating out we tried Hucks on first night - brilliant service from our waitress Dawn &amp; meal was great. Also sampled Sports Bar &amp; Starbucks during our stay plus used the Dining In takeaway service on final night which was lovely . All menus are available on CP website which was useful as a price &amp; choice guide in advance The lake was beautiful during the hot weather with a lovely sandy beach area - small amount of free sunbeds there which were not overused so got some decent sunbathing in - felt just like being abroad !The Swimming pool area is fantastic - even after 2 visits I hadn't realised how much there was to it - main pools with wave machines every half hour, jacuzzi/whirlpools, lazy river which is lovely for non swimmers even babies or the Wild Water rapids for bigger thrill seekers. Lagoon pool lovely &amp; warm .Outdoor pool area at top with sunbeds etc . Best experience was the Tropical Cyclone ride which takes up to 4 on an inflatable raft - also fine for non swimmers - huge drop so big Adrenalin rush! Despite CP being full during our stay we only had to queue about 10 mins at the most for this rideActivity wise we did Segways - best activity we chose &amp; well worth the money - instructor (Josh?) was brilliant. Also did pub quiz , outdoor bowls, ten pin bowling &amp; rowing boats . Ten pin bowling area was also great with a bar &amp; pool tables etc plus a free kids mini disco every nightThe girls in our group had a spa day which was also a highlight of the trip - can't recommend Aqua Sana enough it's outstanding . Food that was included in our package was also excellent &amp; all dietary needs catered for. CP issue wristbands on arrival which act as the key to your lodge plus operate the lockers when in changing rooms at pool or spa - these can be charged with money for spending in pool etc but didn't bother Overall I can't fault our holiday at all - yes CP isn't cheap especially during school holidays when we stayed &amp; yes you could go abroad for same or less money but for me the whole CP experience warrants the cost - living in that forest bubble for a week with no traffic plus wildlife etc is what you pay for &amp; we loved every minute - all CP staff were lovely &amp; customer service was top notch - we will definitely return ud83dude01",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
groupe_5,"We have been to Center Parcs at least 5 times and mostly at Elvedon. Every time I visit Elvedon, I become a little more disappointed. Might just be because we've been too many times now but it seems to be going downhill. I travelled at the beginning of July with my husband and 2 daughters, 11 and 13. We stayed in a 3 bedroom Executive lodge. Well, if this is an executive lodge, God knows what a Woodland lodge is like because the executive lodge is just average! Small TVs and just feels a bit dated now. It was very hot and there is no air conditioning. We have learned over the years to take a number of fans with us which we did. It would have been unbearable otherwise. The restaurants are not air conditioned so very sweaty!The worst thing were the number of spiders that I saw (not big, fat ones but the spindly leg kind) and they were all over the lodge. Very unpleasant. The area around the lodge was messy - lots of stinging nettles. Needs a real tidy up. Despite all this, we always have a good time as we mainly just swim and bike around and eat. Food isn't cheap and a bit average and I wouldn't recommend the takeaway. All in all, rather mediocre. Might try Sherwood Forest next time.",0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0

So on the last full day of our stay the internal thermostat recorded a central room temperature of 30u02daC and it was hotter in our children's room as that had the full sun on it all day.  It gets worse as we tried to escape the heat and decided we would eat in one of the many restaurants - except they did not turn on the air conditioning on.  When we asked why it was not on we were told that it could not be put on has they had open hatches to the kitchens.  I am sorry I have eaten in Miller and Carter and they have a hatch running the whole length of their restaurant and guess what the A/C is fully on.  I am surprised the staff have not reported Centre Parc to the HSE as i did not know how they worked in that temperature.

groupe_5,"We went to Center Parcs as first time visitors. 3 generations with grandparents and kids aged 13 &amp; 15. Having joined the masses finding a space in the car park we tried to make our way to the Woodland Lodge. It was here we got our first taste of the occasionally confusing, often baffling signage. Arrows point one way then seem to disappear......But we found our lodge. Big enough for the 6 of us although the twin room the kids shared was cramped.The Woodland Lodge was well appointed, comfortable and sufficient for our needs. The coffee machine was a nice bonus too!However, being there when temperatures reached over 30 degrees wasn't pleasant. It's not possible to open the windows particularly wide and the lodge quickly became a sauna. Fortunately we'd packed some fans so got some relief.We hadn't booked a huge number of activities. Our first was a leisurely game of outdoor bowls. In all honestly we struggled to navigate our way around the site. The paper maps provided just aren't detailed enough and the signs are poor. Having eventually found the outdoor bowls area there was no indication of where equipment was. We found a member of staff on another activity who pointed us in the direction of the sports arena. Having joined the queue we finally got our equipment 20 minutes after our booking started. Yes, we got lost, but we're not mind readers and having some form of instructions at the rink would have been helpful.But once we got to know our way around we all had a great time. The quad biking was an instant hit, archery was on target for a great family activity and even geocaching didn't result in any family disputes!!Good selection of eateries and shops etc. We used the takeaway delivery service one night and were very impressed.We all came away having had a great family get together.But the one big drawback was simply the lack of air conditioning everywhere. I appreciate it may not be possible to put this in lodges, but having air con in restaurants and bars in this day and age is a must. The only place with it was Starbucks. Hucks restaurant, at 7pm was unbearable and I genuinely felt sorry for the staff and their sweat soaked shirts. I don't think cooling public buildings is too much of an ask.Please don't take this as a negative review. We had a great time and will be back.

We did look under the sofa and bed for rogue toys and it certainly had not been cleaned for months but the rest of the place was good. We booked early evening meals in Bella Italia, Hucks, Cafe Rouge and brunch at Foresters'. They were all very good with play areas in each of them (apart from Cafe Rouge) which kept the little one busy. We didn't hire bikes and felt it was easy enough to walk everywhere which was fine. We stayed quite far out too and it was only 10 minutes to the village square so bikes are not necessary if you don't want one. The highlights for the toddler were; soft play at the Sports Cafe, the playground outside of Jardin du Sport, feeding the ducks, watching the giant fish, jumping in puddles, the kids disco in the Leisure Bowl (6-9 most evenings I think), running in the forest paths, Baby Owls, baby Dolphins early session in the pool for under 3's, toddler water slides and watching the squirrels out of the patio doors. It was so easy here with a little one and because everyone is there with children you don't feel worried your toddler shouting and running around will spoil someone's weekend away! I think for parents it helps a lot. The woodland lodges are nice and safe for little ones to play with no stairs to worry about and nice open plan living. The travel cot and high chair were in very good condition. Yes it is expensive. August bank holiday was ridiculously so.

The outside of the lodge is disgusting. Food wrappers, dirty plasters, bits of tissue all over the place. We complained to guest services and to their credit, they sent two cleaners to the lodge to clean the floors but they spent 2 minutes hoovering and then left.The changing rooms in the pool are disgusting and look like they haven't been cleaned in a good while. The general state of the facilities is poor, really run down and in need of modernisation.When we arrived at the Park, we were told to park in the car park and use the facilities until 3pm when we would have access to our lodge. Easier said than done! Spent 45 minutes driving round, looking for a parking space and waiting for the weekend visitors to go home. Why tell people to arrive at 11 and also tell the current incumbents that they can use the Park all day (as long as they check out at 10) if you don't have enough parking spaces for both groups?This is our first (and last) visit to Centre Parcs.

The ledge around the fire was caked in dust/soot, and 2 of the kitchen cupboard had broken bottom hinges so doors did not close properly.Beds were comfy with nice bedding, the kitchen and bathrooms were modern, fabulous bath and power showers, but windows and outside of the villa's was looking tired.They were also short of staff on the Sunday so the villa wasn't cleaned that day.  We had a lovely meal in Huck's (Alice was a wonderful waitress) and we really enjoyed the Pancake House.Swimming pool was great fun, we also enjoyed ten pin bowling and table tennis.  Our children went on The Drop and the High Ropes which ended with them zip wiring across the lake.Only think that spoiled the weekend was finding a note on our car windscreen on Monday morning, it was left by a fellow guest who witnessed a Center Parcs employee reverse into our car and damage it on the Friday afternoon. He spoke to the driver and told her it needed reporting but she simply said 'she had finished her shift and was going home' and drove off instead.  Thankfully the gentleman reported the incident to Centre Parcs and gave his contact details and the vehicle registration number, which will help us out enormously getting our car repaired.

groupe_5,"Just back from a mon-fri trip to Sherwood Forest centerparcs. We had a wonderful time. We were at whinfell in June which was equally as wonderful. At whinfell we had a refurbished lodge as we had read some trip advisor reviews which often slated the basic woodland lodges. We loved whinfell so much that we booked another week, but this time at Sherwood (on our route home from a wedding). This time we just went for the basic woodland lodge as we hadn't really planned on 2 holidays this summer! Anyway, the only difference we could see between the basic and the refurbished woodland lodges was the lack of tassimo coffee machine in the basic lodge. We knew that beforehand so actually cud have brought our own machine from home but chose not to. Sherwood seems much bigger than whinfell in terms of the number of lodges and consequently cycle routes through the forest and a few extra kids play parks and possibly tennis courts. That was a plus but then if there are more lodges they need to have more facilities. The pool wasn't any bigger than whinfell. There was a v good multiperson rubber ring slide called Grand cascade at Sherwood which whinfell doesn't have and the rapids seemed better at Sherwood. I would say though that the pool seemed much more u201ctiredu201d than whinfell. It was clean enough, it just is starting to look dated in places. We did appreciate the wrist band keys at whinfell (which Sherwood didn't have) that worked for your lodge and pool locker. Other difference was that the village shops and restaurants at Sherwood were set out more as individual units accessed by an uncovered path type area, whereas at whinfell they are all under a glass dome. Pros and cons for both options. We were at whinfell in the heatwave of June and the glass dome with lack of air con and fans meant that we cancelled our restaurant booking as the heat was unbearable. I'm sure the glass dome would be appreciated with more normal British weather! The lake at Sherwood felt more remote and removed from the rest of the village compared to whinfell where it's at the centre, again both have pros and cons. If we were choosing again between whinfell or Sherwood, we would probably choose whinfell. Whinfell just seems newer and more well cared for. Plus when travelling from Northern Ireland, whinfell is closer, particularly with all the roadworks on English motorway! We are hoping though that Longford Ireland will open on time for summer'19!At whinfell, our daughter did some of the unaccompanied parties at u201cthe denu201d. She seemed to enjoy them. At Sherwood, we did all of our activities with her, and we all enjoyed that much more. The young lady called Emily at Sherwood who braided our daughter's hair is a natural with kids. A day or two later we went for an archery session and Emily was leading it. She remembered our daughter. This staff member is about to start primary teacher training and it showed, she was superb with the kids. High commendation deserved! Our daughter took sick whilst we were at Sherwood, so we went along to the medical  centre. The nurse Lucy was wonderful. She got right down to Child's level to the point where our shy and reserved daughter was showing Lucy her ballet moves! Lucy was fantastic, took lots of time to properly assess her which was v reassuring and gave us info about local out of hours services,  in case her condition worsened at night. Lucy reassured us to come back to see her again if we had any doubt or just wanted to check our daughters stats. My husband met her in the car park the next day and she remembered him and asked about our daughter. All of this was completely free of charge- obviously included in the fee we paid to be at centerparcs. It was brilliant though to be able to rock up to the medical centre without an appointment or prior warning, without charge and we were seen immediately with the utmost professionalism. I had realised on our trip at whinfell that this is even offered by centerparcs. Hopefully we won't need the service on any future centerparcs visits but we just thought we would sing their praises.We also had cause to go to the visitor info centre twice and yet again staff were extremely friendly and dealt promptly with our queries.Despite trip advisor reviews of the basic woodland lodges been not well cleaned, this was not our experience. It was every bit as clean as the refurbished lodge. I had to move 2 beds together for our daughter (she's used to a double at home and liable to fall out of a single). I found no dirt under the bed. The whole lodge was spotless. My only small issue with the basic lodge was the toilet in the main bathroom. Whoever installed the toilet roll holder obviously never tried sitting on the loo! We are not big people and we had to check every time we sat on the loo that we didn't bang our sides on the holder. But in the grand scheme of things, that was a minor issue! Oven was spotlessly clean. People complain on trip advisor about getting v little in the way of things like dishwasher tablets. We had 3. We had no need to use the ones I brought with me. So in summary, I feel lots of the trip advisor reviews need to be taken with a large pinch of salt! The pool at Sherwood is currently having a new slide installed. The work is however being done from the outside and at the moment is having no affect on guests ability to use pool facilities (apart from poolside Starbucks being out of action- but there is another poolside cafe).

The toilet seat didn't fit properly as it had been replaced with a non fitted seat which meant it was uncomfortable. There is a lot of service vehicles driving around the traffic free area throughout the day. Unfortunately we were disappointed by this visit and wouldn't recommend this centreparcs.

The staff were probably the friendliest happiest staff iv ever seen on a holiday so nice and helpful.

We had an executive villa, which was good, every room had an ensuite. It was well appointed, cleaned every day, was fine for the family. Most of the activity takes place in or around the pool area, for us about a 1.2 km walk, Something to bear in mind if it's hot or wet. No cars allowed. The pool was large with lots of slides, rapids etc but being hot..was very busy. Good time to go is evening, more people having diner than swimming. Now the restaurants. We used a couple Bella Italian and Hucks. Hucks does American food ie burgers and ribs. It's basic and a bit barn like. Bella was unbearably hot as it had a partial glass roof. Food in Hucks was better, but neither were very good. There are a couple of Starbucks on site. We used the one by the pool. To be frank it was dirty and full of flies. If you want a quiet coffee or meal, go up to the country club. Lovely and peaceful as hardly anyone goes there. Overall this place is fine.

groupe_5,"I travelled with my Mum, Dad and the annoying 11 year old who is usually attached to an 'e' device.  When we finally got there the lady at the arrivals lodge talked through the adult stuff and then I heard Dad tell her my name and that I was a cream brindle in case I should escape.  The lady explained that when I was in the villa we would need to display a plaque in the window informing house-keeping or maintenance of my presence u2013 a fierce mutt that could lick them to death!!  It would also mean that once we left the villa in a week's time that a 'deep clean' would be carried out before the new guests arrived.  Mum was passed a detailed information sheet for dog owners.We found our villa around the one way system 573 Oak and whilst the grown-ups unpacked I checked out the surroundings.  There was an open plan kitchen lounge area with 2 bedrooms, bathroom and a cloakroom with my favourite boiler cupboard and safe.  I was able to sit on the sofa and watch the going's on, whilst the 11 year old watched just one more 'You-Tube' video.  Mum &amp; Dad are seasoned pet-friendly accommodation travellers and remembered the trusty sleeping bag to use as a throw on that nice white bed linen.  They tried to suggest I sleep with the 11 year old as there was more room but he blows off more than I do!!!Once we'd parked up we walked to Guest Services to get a plaque as there wasn't one in our villa.  The other 2 went swimming so Mum and I walked back to the villa, we checked out the closest dog exercise area which must have been 30' x 40', this was great for a dog my size as I could be finally let off the lead to check out all the corners for any dozy squirrels.Out the back of our villa was a patio area opening onto a footpath where there were many squirrels and rabbits to look out for, on one day a squirrel even came to sit on the patio table u2013 taunting me it was.  Dad noticed that the villa next door had a post in the ground with a ring for attaching our leads too but our villa didn't have one of these, Mum &amp; Dad just used the base of the patio table to secure the lead to. When Dad was cooking on the bbq, I kept guard as I was sure to get one of those sausages.On a trip to Parc Market Mum checked out the pet food shelf, it seems okay if you like Pedigree Chum but fortunately my Mum loves me and had packed my bag of food and treats along with all the other paraphernalia (including the kitchen sink) well that's what Dad says.Mum asked if she could add a couple of pictures to my vlog as she was trying to find out what utensils come in a 2 bedroom woodland plus if you get a coffee machine or cafetiere before we left please see 2 pictures.All in all I had a great time, yes I couldn't go into any of the public buildings on site and I had to remain on my lead but there were far too many squirrels and rabbits to look for and loads of fans making a fuss of me as we walked through the village square.  I hope they take me again to Center Parcs as in the villa I was allowed to go in all the rooms and on the furniture even when I was left guarding the place although Mum &amp; Dad usually remembered to shut the bedroom doors when they went out u2013 there is nothing quite so soft as a Center Parc's pillow!",1.0,1.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0

groupe_5,"So, we have been to Center Parcs a few times over the years and do love the place (Sherwood is our 'local' but also our favourite). Firstly I have to deal with the negative and the reason for the title of this review - COST - it is expensive, and everything on site is expensive and nearly everything is extra, understand this and accept it and you will have a great time.The lodges have had some refurb since our last visit and are of good quality considering we weren't in any of the more expensive accommodation. The wi-fi is free and seemed to have pretty good coverage, and had suitable bandwidth so no constant buffering. If you are 'eating in' the kitchen facilities are small and minimal but adequate - shop before you go and you will save as the on parc store is expensive and limited.The bedrooms are comfy and have hair dryers and there is an iron &amp; Ironing board.We took our own bikes so I can't talk to the on site rentals, and for those not in the know this and walking is the only way around, you are not permitted vehicles on site - something that adds to the holiday and feel of the site.We had pre-booked an activity most days and whilst there is a cost for these every one we attended was great fun, well managed, and generally good value (per-booking helps you forget the cost - lol).We were also lucky enough to get good weather something that always helps here in the UK! this meant though that we could have been anywhere in europe, with the setting, scenery, and weather.We also spent extra to attend the Aqua Sana (spa) something we always enjoy, and well worth the money it costs, our teenage daughter came with us for her first experience and also loved it - men, if you are frowning at reading this give it a try it really is a truly relaxing experience!All in all if you understand what you are booking you will love this place, it's not cheap but it is great family place.",0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0

Nestled in a forest, Sherwood Centre Parcs was everything we expected.We arrived on Monday, and stayed for 4 nights. Although rather hectic on arrival day, the check in was smooth. The lodge was great. Woodland Lodge 215 was positioned near a river/water feature, with lots of ducks and swans. The children enjoyed feeding the ducks and swans (oh and cheeky squirels). We did have a visitor one afternoon, with a swan taking time to hunt for food in the villas. The villas was perfect. We had everything for the stay.Bikes were hired for the week. The kids enjoyed the cycle around the Parc. Although cycling on a Monday and Friday, around the times of loading and unloading, isn't advised due to traffic.The activities were great, with the staff delivering excellent briefs prior to the start of each activity. My boys did the mini quads, which they thoroughly enjoyed. The girls who delivered the activity, did so in a safe and pleasant manner. Laser combat was excellent and good value. Falconry was interesting. The bowling alley was good. There is 2 bowling venues, one in the sports bar and the bowling alley itself. The bowling alley itself, had a children's disco from 1830hrs to 2100hrs. The pool was great. We swam early evening and felt that we beat the peak times. Due to the time of year, we did a swim at 1945hrs and had the excitement of the coloured lights on. Well worth a night swim, if you can. In closing, a great holiday was had. We stayed in budget; ate out at times; pre booked our activities; relaxed in the villas and had lots of fun.Highlights: cycling around; Pancake house; WIFI everywhere; wildlife near villas; pool at night; the staff were brilliant; the kids play parks; the VR experience; laser combat; the Aqua Sana.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
groupe_5,"Just returned from a lovely long weekend. Villa had issues but these have been addressed by Center Parcs and hopefully in the not too distant future the management will really get to grips with the multitude of complaints in this area and address it. Moving on to the parc itself and it was just as beautiful and peaceful as ever, despite looking full to capacity. Play areas all working and kept clean, environment appeared rubbish free and any cars who were illegally parked after drop off time had notices to be removed. Jardin de Sports and Country Club were expensive (Its Center Parcs - no surprise!) but both are welcoming and clean so I will take the cost. Supermarket extremely expensive but it serves a need so again, expected. We normally go in July but went late August this year and angry wasps were everywhere and talking to staff this always happens in August, so if anyone has serious issues with wasps, suggest avoiding in August/September. A huge thank you to the girls who ran the horse and carriage rides It was our second year on the carriage and once again they were absolutely lovely, allowing my granddaughter to ride up front on the carriage and chatting as they went, a credit to Center Parcs and yet not directly employed by CP apparently. There is work going on and there are two huge cranes on site but you would need to be really picky to say they affected your enjoyment, after all the only reason they are there is to make the environment even better. The usual woodland creatures everywhere - squirrels, ducks, swans etc, an absolute delight for any young children.Center Parcs is taking a great deal of stick at the moment from guests for the state of some villas, as a regular for over 30 years I am truly saddened they have got themselves in this mess - Sort your cleaners and maintenance out, be it by re training, incentives or extra time in each villa, whatever it takes please just do it as you have a truly wonderful place down at Sherwood and it is suffering unnecessarily by blinkered management who are not addressing the serious issues in the villas.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0

The next morning we noticed just how dirty our lodge was, the worst being that there was hardened bird poo caked on the inside of the patio door. To make matters worse this appeared to have been there for a while. I reported this &amp;  2 hours later a cleaning team were sent around , removing the bulk of the mess but another stain remained. I was later left an insulting voicemail by guest services saying that they had sorted the problem and these matters were &quot;outside their control&quot;. It may be that previous guests leaving doors open &amp; letting wildlife in to do their business is outside of their control. However, what is inside of their control is ensuring lodges are clean before the next guests arrive. As a mark of 'goodwill' they sent a mini bottle of proseco &amp; a few pieces of chocolate. Not good enough centerparcs - when you charge over ¬£1,000 for a 4 night stay the lodge should be clean before we arrive.The lodge is also tired, has a feisty smell &amp; some of the utilities dont work as well as they should.Other gripes are that the place is overcrowded, putting strain on the swimming pool. They seem to have knocked up more executive lodges where the driving range used to be and this has increased the crowds.The pool &amp; slides are good but too many people cause long queues &amp; unregulated chaos on the rapids.

The lodge was also not very well cleaned with cobwebs, dust you could write your name in and some dirty marks. This was the biggest let down of the holiday. I also felt that the beach and lake area was not as nice as Sherwood. The beach was very small and there was nothing much going on on it whilst Sherwood has a large beach with a play area and lots of people on it enjoying themselves. Despite this, we had a good holiday and enjoyed the subtropical swimming a lot. The kids area was amazing and we had great fun in the wave pool too. The changing rooms were good, although were cleaner in the mornings. The piazza was lovely too and it was nice to see a musician playing a set in there one evening on the stage.

groupe_5,"I visited Center Parcs on the first weekend of August and we booked the Executive Lodge. We were very lucky as we went while the weather was great and it never rained once. One thing to mention is when you drive to the accommodation area the roads are quite narrow. We stayed close the main area but it was still a very private place you will only see your neighbours once or twice. The only times you bump into people are when you are going around the park or at activities. It is definitely worth getting a bike while you're there, we got the cheapest bikes and they were light and had gears from 1-8, that's all you'll need for the weekend.The lodge was great for 2 people but would be rather cramped for 4 people. The lodge was brilliant. For people planning to go toilet paper is provided and you can request more for free and further free towels. We didn't know how to use the dishwasher at first so that would be something to include in the guest manual. It would be good if they had a smart TV as a suggestion. The only downfall for the accommodation was the amount of spiders in the corners of the windows and skylights. Obviously you're in a middle of a forest so you're going to have spiders around but I felt as though the skylights hadn't been cleaned in a few months. I just ended hoovering up spiders while I was there. If you are planning to come to Center Parcs make sure you book it at least 4/5 months in advance to get the best choice of the activities. The only place that was slightly difficult to find was the outdoor activity centre so they may benefit from placing some directions for that place. The highlight was Aqua Sana spa if you are going as a couple then the spa session is a must. It's best to book 1 or 2 activities per day to make sure you have time to bike around and chill. The staff were absolutely brilliant so friendly and always asked how your stay is going. Every time I needed help and I didn't have a lot of time I would just call guest services and they were always happy to provide answers and could call them throughout the day. The housekeeper that visited us on the Saturday was super friendly and helped us with the dishwasher. When we were out on the lake and got stuck a staff member called Ant helped us get back to the dock and even offered for us to come back the next day. We really appreciated his help and understanding. On our last day we decided to get food from dining in before we leave and there was a wasp flying around and one of the members of staff Sophie/Louise managed to trap the wasp for us so that we could eat. She was very accommodating and came out to provide plates and cutlery for us and then managed to trap a wasp too.

groupe_5,"I have been to Center Parcs several times and chose it this time as I was going with my elderly parents and my daughter and her small baby and it seemed to cater for everyone's needs. We weren't disappointed. Our woodland lodge in Maple had all we needed and wasn't too far from The Village to walk although my mum was in a wheelchair and it was quite a hike between venues for my dad. We discovered the mobility service, though, which was fantastic. Some really lovely drivers - Brian, Graeme and Brad provided an excellent taxi service in their especially adapted vans which take passengers seated in their  wheelchairs. This meant we could could walk with the pram and meet them at restaurants or wherever without them worrying about the walk. The staff on the electric boats were also cheery and got mum into the boat easily so she could enjoy the trip and she was able to use a frame in the bowling abbey for her to roll the ball down. This really helped to boost her confidence as she had been concerned she wouldn't be able to do anything. The restaurants we visited - Cafe Rouge and Forresters Inn - weren't cheap but the food was good and again, the staff were brilliant - very friendly and willing to accommodate the  pram and wheelchair. The whole place is really geared up for families but we were a bit disappointed with the lack of feeding and changing rooms across the site, compared with the newer park at  Woburn. Generally, Sherwood is looking a bit tired in comparison though they are doing a lot of refurbishment of the pool area ( new flumes and changing rooms) and the new lodges round the Country Park are lovely as is the Nature Centre. Many of the lodges are in need of a facelift but ours was really clean and I have no complaints on that score. We found enough to do and really enjoyed the quietness at night and the environment of the forest. It wasn't a cheap few days, though and it was a bit of a mission unloading and especially loading with everyone trying to leave at the same time as the roads aren't wide and there wasn't much parking space near the lodges. It also takes quite a time to exit the site.

We stayed in one of the Oak lodges and so were near the main facilities. The lodge was clean, the only downside was the towel rail didnt work whatever temperature I turned it too. Had we been here a week trying to dry towels and swimwear would have been a nightmare. Having been to previous center parcs'  we know the prices for activities and food aren't the cheapest but budget ahead to make the most of our time here. We found the staff here to be some of the friendliest and chattiest. Jill in the Pancake House was very good. We also visited the aqua sana and enjoyed our time there, especially the hot tubs. However I feel Woburn's aqua sana is the best with more experiences within it. It just needs some hot tubs!A lot of people say Sherwood is looking tired but it just felt well established and reminded us of the center parcs we knew when we first started going. It has had upgrading in places such as the lodges and village square as well as more upgrading continuing. Loading cars on check out day, the narrow roads are very busy and tight to get by. Also sometimes cars would go both ways, possibly a one way system would make it safer for all or maybe signage not visible enough, hence cars both ways. We both agreed we would visit Sherwood again.

Decided to have a full week (7 days) this summer as a treat as we've had a tough year and chose to go to Sherwood Forest for a change.  The site seems a lot bigger than then Whinfell and a lot flatter.  Whinfell has a possible advantage that the main village (where most of the shops and restaurants are) is all under cover (better for winter)  whereas Sherwood Forest is outdoors  - but as it is August this was fine.    Our lodge felt a little tired - the bath didn't drain properly, so even a quick shower left 5 inches of water which took ages to drain away.  The sofa looked tired and there was a slightly foisty smell around the living area.  As always the staff are generally very friendly and helpful in the sports activities and shops (although possibly a bit over the top in the Parc Market).    Prices (also as always) are high!!!  I haven't yet checked my credit card account to see how much I spent...   Now for the snobby bit - there seemed to be a lot more baseball caps and hoodies than we were used to seeing at Whinfell Forest.   My week was also tarnished by a very aggressive man in a playground who told me he was going to &quot;put me in the xxxxing hospital&quot; after something apparently happened between our kids!  Hmmm.   Fortunately this was on our last full day  - I chose not to report this but would have done had it been earlier in the week as my OH felt very uncomfortable about crossing paths with these people again. I realise I cant blame this on Center Parcs and I don't know how they would have dealt with it had I chose to report the incident.

Yes we booked a Woodland Lodge instead of Exec Villa to save money due to hiked prices, but it was horrid.  It seems they wedge these lodges into gaps between nice ones that don't fit anything else.  It  was dark, badly laid out, small and smelly.  We knew it would be smaller but didn't expect it to smell.  The twin room in particular I had to keep spraying air freshner in, if you left the door open it stank.  What was also disapointing was no animals came to the door for food.  At Elveden we see lots of squirrels, ducks, rabbits and deer, here nothing apart from the odd duck.  It was expensive as always so we expected that but we were so shocked at how shabby it was compared to Elveden.  The pool was very dissapointing, less to do their also.  Things seemed very poorly laid out over the park.  The bowling alley area was tiny compared to Elveden, really dissapointing.  The same with the Sports Cafe, laid out like a canteen, souless.What I can say is the staff as always at CP were great, so friendly and helpful, they couldn't do enough for you.  Its not their fault the park is shabby and they really deserve alot of praise for the great job they do.Come on CP sort this park out, it was such a let down and it seems alot of people have the same comments.Suffice it to say we left early as we'd had enough of the place and won't be going back.",1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0

Although visitors are not allowed to bring their cars on the roads, except on arrival and leaving days, the number of bikes and Center Parc staff vehicles makes the roads busy and you have to be careful and watch young children closely on the road, so walking on the roads is not relaxing. In fact, you can't allow children much freedom at all, because the roads are busy, it is big, very crowded, and easy to get lost.I have a rotten sense of direction and getting lost was a real problem for me. I got lost at least once every day for a week. The signs are very confusing. Some point in opposite directions for the same place. Later I discovered that is because some are for cars and some for pedestrians, but it's not clear. I would follow a sign to a place and then get to a junction with no sign for the same place. In some places there are signs to the lodges and in other places there are not. They use obscure words for facilities. I can't remember the one for the swimming pools, but it definitely didn't include the word 'pool'.So, lots to praise, but I would not go again, unless it was to be with family who wanted to go. However, we heard from people who went back again and again, so it depends on what you like.",0.0,,1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0

When we went, they were trialling being able to park up by the lodge immediately on arrival. Lodges are then available from 3pm. Only gripe is that everything you buy is fairly expensive, so day to day costs can be quite high. However, out of all of the parks, this is one of my favourites with quite a few play parks and restuarants, including Italian, Indian and a pancake house . All in all a nice and relaxing holiday.

groupe_5,"We're just back from a mid-week stay here having been on numerous occasions in the past. I think it's fair to say we won't return again for the following reasons: - The bed in the master bedroom was like sleeping on rubble, it's laughable that CP advertise these beds for sale! - The rapids in the swimming pool are ruined by people not following the rules for safety, with lifeguards not intervening when people are walking up the rapids or are going down in large groups which is dangerous for those following the rules. - People on bikes are dangerous, it shouldn't be that hard to designate cycle lanes. One of our children is deaf and it was stressful every time we walked anywhere due to him not being able to hear them approaching, CP is not disability friendly in this way. - Service in all of the restaurants with the exception of Bella Italia (this restaurant was by far the best at CP) was haphazard, slow and at times rude! The worst meal was Forrester's Inn - how a simple ham, egg and chips can be so wrong is beyond me! Really very poor.

Our lodge was clean, spacious and had everything we needed to cook. A few clesning bits but best to bring extas! TV is slightly odd you cant get all channels and the front door doesnt lock from the inside which is a bit of a worry with a little one but does have a chain.It was so hot when we went and with no windows in the lodge and not being able to open the door due to ducks trying to get in it was like a sauna during the day! Air con would be good ud83dude01Swimming is amazing especially for kids. We done build a bear and mucky pups they were both great lots of effort put in for the kids.

I love the open planning of the lodges. The decoration and the set up. It makes it so comfortable and social. The bedrooms have such comfortable beds. Bathroom with a jacuzzi was a touch of class and very relaxing and TBH much needed after a busy day in the parc. The on site facilities are really good. Lots of choice regarding restaurants and shopping. You can purchase items from the supermarket I would just say the supermarket I found soooo expensive. I had the best milkshake from one of the food outlets. Swimming area is absolutely outstanding, so much choice of pools, slides  and rapids also the scary ride of the cyclone which is a must. There are coffee shops scattered around.  The pool is all FREE to use. Activities there is enough to do of so many different types water, land, bikes, climbing, bird experiences, indoor and out door. We choose Segway, spa and electric boats. The spa was the best one I have ever visited and I have been to lots of different ones. There was so much to do I would recommend the spa to all . It has an outside area which has plenty of beds and chairs and trees. About 12 different steam rooms. Relaxing beds inside. Chill out rooms. Lovely water free with free fruit. The ladies who came to clean were always so thoughtful and wanted to help you where they could. One offered to take our recycling. It was one of the best weekends ever. I really enjoyed it.

We had a great time but over the years have seen the prices rise but the standard of the accommodation overall slip.

As a fairly well travelled individual, I find it amazing that people rate this place as excellent compared to other resorts the world over which provide as much entertainment, higher standards of cleanliness and much much better food for less money. I think most people know by now that the villas are generally shabby and worn out! The pool changing areas are frankly disgusting. I never saw a cleaner once in there. Rusting flaking walls and fittings, tissue, hair (I mean loads of massive old manky clumps!) cracked tiles, what looked like poo smeered on the cubicle walls...smelled this time of wee almost everywhere...I didn't want to touch a single thing! It's been a standing joke for some years that at least one of our group always ends up with some illness or eye infection after swimming and I'm not surprised. How can you keep the same worn out changing areas for over 30 years and not refurbish them and charge 5* prices?Kids love it here and that's why 99% of people go. However, when you weigh it all up it's cheaper to go to a 5* holiday village or water park resort abroad and have the same activities and kids clubs and food included in your holiday! Let's think about it, if this was abroad we would all be straight onto the tour operator complaining!

groupe_5,"We went in July and booked a cabin with an outdoor BBQ which was sadly unable to be used because of the warm weather - and since we wouldn't have wanted to use it in the cold weather either we soon realised this was a pointless addition. The patio area was bordered by a thick carpet of stinging nettles, waist high, rendering outside play at the back impossible. The cabin was lovely and very clean and modern, except the promised state of the art tv the brochure boasted had poor quality reception and didn't even have a working TV guide, showing the last entry to be January - so out of action for several months. We called and had the tv replaced but that was not much better and still no TV guide. One of our party is disabled and another autistic so we planned so be spending a good portion of our time in the cabin. Unfortunately there was no phone in the cabin and no service on mobile so we struggled keeping in contact when we had to be separated - which turned out to be critical at one point when my disabled friends autistic daughter had a meltdown when she was alone with her.When we used the main pool area we discovered none of the jacuzzis were working - one of the only areas my disabled friend was planning on using while I took our children swimming - and they were out of action the whole holiday, and apparantly had been so for the fortnight prior as well. The disability scooters that you can hire 'for the duration of your holiday' actually are required to be returned by 10am on the final day, so despite our break being sold to us as a five day holiday we were obliged to leave and miss most of the last day as my friend was unable to get about. The man was apologetic and said they needed to be charged for the next guests but frankly Centreparcs should be accounting for this when they book them out and have a sufficient supply to loan out. There were also areas that were difficult to access with a scooter that we were not warned about - for example the very steep path in front of the waterside apartments that was our shortest route to access the beach area. The scooter skidded down this area and we nearly had an accident. My daughter completely slid over walking down it and hurt her knee as there is loose muck and gravel over the entire surface that made the slope unsafe. After that we were obliged to take the long way round and traverse three quarters of the lake to get there - but some areas by the lake were again unsafe as the lakeside path would abruptly narrow or change heights with a sudden drop, so in the end we had to stick to the road and miss out on the scenery. Also when the charge on the scooter dropped abruptly one evening there was nowhere that was able to help us charge it up - you would think customer services would keep a cable spare for that kind of emergency - nor could they take the nearly dead scooter away and give us another. So I was obliged to walk back and get the cable from the cabin and hunt down a socket in the central village I could use and beg a shop owner for a bit of electricity - which wasted an hour of my evening, and meant none of my party could do anything without me. But goodness knows what would have happened had I not been able bodied and able to sort my friend out.We also found it difficult to navigate the park, as the areas all look virtually identical it was difficult to work out where you were exactly, and none of the maps dotted about the complex have a 'you are here' marker, so it is difficult to know which path to take if you don't know where you are in the first place. There are only signs for each area on the road and not the pathways. We missed our pottery experience by more than half an hour because of misunderstanding which path we were taking, and when we figured out which was the correct path, we were advised by a member of staff to take an alternate one and instead ended up right the other side to where we needed to be for the second time. However the pottery staff were lovely and allowed us to stay for the rest of the afternoon as they weren't busy. Also I was obliged to walk to collect my car in the middle of the week and ended up walking a circuit round three quarters of the park in the wrong direction because of following the car park signs, that did not indicate they were for car users only to follow a one-way system round the park, and that the car park was in fact in the opposite direction by foot. Since I needed my car to take my daughter to hospital in an emergency this meant I left my very sick daughter for over half an hour longer than I otherwise needed to because of these directions not being clear that they were for car drivers only.It is certainly not catered to those with disabilities, and I would think twice about going again unless I was close to the centre (we were given a cabin on the outer edge).",1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0

The beds and pillows are extremely comfortable and we slept very well. We didn't use the restaurants this time until the Monday lunchtime when we went to the Pancake House. The food was excellent and fairly reasonable considering the high cost of all the restaurants in the square but the restaurant was extremely hot, so much so that my husband wasn't able to stay in there and eat. We know that it was a very hot week-end but there didn't seem to be any air conditioning. Leaving the car park on the Monday was an absolute nightmare and we feel that there should be some sort of marshalling in place to control the traffic jams and make the departure fairer for all.  Whilst we realise it must be a major logistical headache to get so many people in and out we think there could be improvements made. As you leave the site there is a box where you can put your wristbands if you've forgotten to leave them before that point but some people were being very inconsiderate, there were so many on the floor getting ruined and as these must cost a considerable amount this is adding to our costs as a visitor. Surely there must be a better plan to avoid some people's ignorance and lack of concern. The pool is a lot of fun, we loved it. We did all the rides, all fantastic. We hired a cabana too for two of the days so that my 91 year old mother could join in the fun more and we think these are an excellent idea. The step in the pool in front of the cabana though I think should be better marked, it caught me out a couple of times and I have a very bruised toe. I know this is a difficult task to monitor but the changing rooms are far too hot and rather than feeling refreshed as you leave the area, you leave hot and bothered. My grandson did the Off Road Adventure and thoroughly enjoyed it. This is a very well organised activity giving little ones a lot of fun. We also took out 6 pedalos which too were a lot of fun. We would have hired a carriage to tow behind our bike for the grandsons but at ¬£60 we thought this was way too high a price to pay especially as the visit is such a lot of money to book.

Fully equipped kitchen was a little limited meant the dishwasher had to go on after every meal, even breakfast but at least we were given a good supply of dishwasher tablets. It was lovely to have housekeeping each day so we didn't need to empty bins or make beds.To was lovely that all 3 children could do the same activities even if at different times. We did go out to Sherwood Pines for the treetop walk as they allowed the 3 year old to up, which he loved. The swimming pool was a great hit, with enough different pools and slides to keep all age groups happy. Found the ten pin bowling a little strange, you paid by the hour and not game. With waiting for bowl returns meant we had not completed our game in the hour, fortunately they did extend our time so we could complete our game. This was stressful as you were clock watching wondering if you would get your game finished.Although it was a wonderful holiday and the grandchildren loved it, I think it is rather pricey by time you pay for every activity apart from the pool and the playgrounds, which there were plenty and for different ages.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

One of the beds wasn't made up when we arrived but a quick call to guest services and it was promptly sorted. Only two things niggle me about Center Parcs.... they are very mean with toilet rolls to start with. It's a small thing but when you've booked a lodge for 8 people for 4 days, 2 toilet rolls isn't going to be enough and for the money you pay (especially in school holidays), frankly it's just penny pinching and mean. And secondly, there are no big dishes to serve family meals. Again, with 8 people in a self catering lodge there are going to be large meals cooked and therefore larger receptacles in which to serve them would be an obvious improvement. Other than that, all good. In particular the staff were great, especially Harry and Lois on Aerial Adventure.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0

First time to Elveden which is a lot flatter than longleat! We weren't able to hire bikes as we had the buggy but definitely worth it to get around. Unlike longleat, most of the amenities are in one place but it was quite a walk to get to the outdoor activity centre. Our son did the off road explorer activity which he enjoyed. The beach area was nice but it was so hot and there was no shade at all so it was way too hot to stay there for long. Some parasols on the beach would've been nice. The only restaurant we booked was Hucks but with a toddler and a baby we didn't want to be tied down with bookings. We ate at sports cafe and pancake house and didn't have problems getting a table (might be difficult if it was school holidays though!)We borrowed a bike lock from the cycle centre to park the buggy at the buggy park outside the swimming pool or you can buy one for ¬£3 at the cycle centre or parc market. There were other buggies not locked but we didn't want to take the chance. Stayed in one of the new woodland lodges (332) which was nice. It was really clean when we arrived.

We were told we would not be allowed back in to our reserved seats once the show started. We joked with the staff about how on earth they could work in the heat. We tried to stay in the restaurant but it was not possible. My 6 year old daughter felt that she was going to be physically ill. We asked if there was a fan but told no. I took her out for air but she was feeling too unwell to return. We all then followed suit with it being simply too hot to remain. We were offered no discount or refund at the time which was most disappointing given none of us saw the show and still were charged for our drinks on top of having paid already for the carvery. The staff told us there was nothing they could do. That night my husband and mother in law both suffered with stomach issues. We went to the service centre the next day and  management recognised there was an issue with heat in the venue but that there were no immediate plans to deal with this.

Friday morning I had spent ¬£80 at the butchers on bbq meat, planning two bbqs with my family, one on Friday and one on Sunday, my birthday.  Why couldn't the news of this fire ban have come via email before we came so I wouldn't have bought all that meat with me. We are bombarded with messages before we come - book this, reserve that, make sure you do this or that so you have a great time.  Why not mention the fire ban so we could have made different plans. The advise I was given was that I could cook it in the oven and did I need any more pans.  Well thanks, but no -  we didn't come away for a special weekend to cook in the kitchen!! And who likes bbq food cooked in the oven?  But we had to bite the bullet and do just that on Friday as we hadn't booked in anywhere else and CP's was heaving!  Saturday we went to Bella Italia and it was hot (no air conditioning) and noisy (in a stuffy booth next to the childrens' play area and a hen party!).  I had requested twice earlier for a table on the terrace.  They said they would try their best for us - but they didn't try hard enough - no-one was eating on the terrace!  On Sunday, we couldn't stand the thought of cooking the rest of the meat in the oven - it was a sweltering weekend and obviously dining al fresco on our lovely patio wasn't an option due to the bbq ban.  So at 8.30pm we all looked through the wonderful take away menu conveniently left on the table in the lodge.  There was a lovely choice and, after deciding what we would all like to order, we phoned up and had to wait, 5th in the queue, 4th in the queue ... and then we got through and, guess what?  &quot;We've stopped taking any further take away orders this evening, but we can bring you a pizza at 10.30!!!!!!  At which point, after a glass or two of bubbly - it was my 60th on that day after all - I flipped!!  I don't like losing my temper, but I got the disposable bbq and put in on the brick stand, a bucket of water at the ready for safety, and I lit the bloody barbeque!  We did cook the meat just in  time before the Security Guard came and watched us pour water on the hot coals.  But we fell out as a family over it because we had broken the rules and some didn't want to do that.

groupe_5,"9 of us stayed at Elveden Mon-Fri 8 in an Exec lodge &amp; 1 in waterfront apartments. This was a gift bought for my sisters &amp; kids (13-26 years) from our mum that died a few months previously. The weather was glorious just perfect so our stay was great - however had it not been I'm not sure we could have afforded all the extra activities we would have had to pay to keep the teens occupied. We did golf, archery,kayaking and I treated my niece to a spa day which was surprisingly very good. The exec lodges were great each had En-Suite but the kitchen was too small to cook for 8 near adults - not enough fridge/freezer space at all! Lovely house keeping staff - which we didn't expect - great large store room we could shove teens stuff in. Tv remotes didn't have batteries in sadly! Parking for drop off &amp; pick up dire why they don't convert the grotty grass front to more parking spaces I'm not sure - 1 space per 2 8 bed lodges - we had 3 cars alone! You all need bikes that was great tho top tip put a ribbon round yours to identify it amongst the hundreds there!

groupe_5,"This was our first experience of Centerparcs and we had a good time. We stayed in a new woodland lodge which we were impressed with. It was spacious and well equipped however could have been cleaner. When we got back from dinner on the first evening there were so many flies in the lodge, despite us having closed all the windows. Behind the radiators were lots of dead flies. I realise we were in a forest in the middle of a heatwave so expected that this was just part of the territory. The next day we asked at guest services and they immediately offered to come in and spray the lodge, which they did very promptly and this got rid of all the flies. I was very impressed with this service! Guest services said house keeping would come in and clean the dead flies away- this definitely did not happen as there were so many left around the windows but to be fair I was just glad they were dead!The pool is amazing! You could literally spend most of your holiday here. Very well equipped with vest floats for wee one and so much to do. We ate in Bella italia, pancake house and did the dining in. We found it very expensive and Bella italia was very hit and miss in terms of service and food quality. We found all the centerparc staff we came across to be friendly and helpful. The wee supermarket is well stocked but expensive! The activities range from quite reasonably priced to way over the top expensive which is such a shame! I don't know why they feel they need to inflate prices so much! There is a free disco at night which my kids loved so this was a big positive for us. Would return to centerparcs but not for a while- could have had a week in Spain for the same price. ",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0

On arrival beds not made. Easily solved after phone call to housekeeping but ,,,,,,,Wildlife fantastic but also rats kept appearing as well , something never experienced here before , again reported it and they sent someone but.......two days later still rats kept visiting .. had to keep patio doors shut , not brilliant in this heat. Also chalets not really very clean, and bit tatty, peeling wall paper , cracked doors etc. The accommodation is charged at the higher end of the market especially at this time of year, so I would expect it to be immaculate. I could suggest deep clean would be appropriate and a overall update of the decor of the chalets to make it feel not so grubby when you are staying in there. Food , all chains on the park , no independent, expensive, predictable, we stayed on and cooked, or went out of centre parcs to eat, which contradicts the ethos of the relaxation of centre parcs. The good things :-Lodges  brilliantly positioned so it does feel like you are secluded in a forest. Loads of wildlife , even saw a mole! Very quiet slept great and did feel relaxed. Loved the beach and the kayaking. Loved some of the activities we did like cup cake making. My highlight was the scuba diving , Phil the instructor was fantastic, professional, brilliant teacher , thank you so much fantastic time!

We tend to favour Whinfell as it is closer to us.We checked in smoothly but then struggled to find a car parking place had to drive round for ages to squeeze into the only available one. My son checked in 10 minutes later and was allowed to drive straight to the lodge and park up. We both had paid for early arrival into the lodge. No consistency there.The lodge was lovely, we had booked a new build 3 bedroom executive with a hot tub outside.The position was great,we got the sun all day right up till late evening, perfect for sitting out till 10 at night.The lodge was bigger than previous 3 bedroom executives we had stayed in. Unfortunately the fridge was tiny and totally inadequate for a weeks stay. Still very new and clean in appearance a lot better than previous lodges we have stayed in.Very close to the Country Club and very private.Supermarket had been improved since we were last there but didn't find as good as previous years.We ate out at Hucks. Very hot with no air conditioning and menu very poor, very glad to get out of there.Bella Italia was much cooler and very nice meal.Cafe Rouge was hot and evening meal was good also great Afternoon Tea very good value and very tasty.Parks are okay but not as good as Whinfell. No swings for a 9 month old!Improving the swimming and slides will be up and running mid next year but didn't impact on what they have now.Mini Jet Skis a waste of money for 10 minutes, they no sooner get on and times up.The Parc itself is a delight and I spent the whole week with a smile on my face. It also helped that we got such great weather.I like Whinfell and Sherwood equally although Whinfell is better in winter as everything is close by as Sherwood is more spread out so you walk or ride more.",1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

There is limited nightlife, but that reduces the risk of drunk hordes staggering out of a disco in the early hours making a noise..  its just a pleasant place to be.  the lodges are huge, and well equipped, and well hidden, walking to our lodge, its hard to image that there is a cluster of families and people in and around you, its so peaceful.  Our lodge carpets were in need of a good clean or replacing, and the door catch was a little worn, but considering the amount of people that must have stayed there, it was minor wear and tear.  The staff were by and large very pleasant, and always looking to help our break go smoothly..  The restaurant food was excellent, although Huck's wasn't as good as I once remembered it.. the staff at Huck's and Bella Italia seemed a little stressed, but this was most probably down to the heat and no air conditioning, indeed we were all dripping in sweat whilst eating out during the exceptional high heat of July.

We went out of Center Parcs and into Sherwood Pines and used equipment to find bats flying nearby. The only other small issue we had was due to the big football games being on at the time, our quiz night had been cancelled but we weren't told until we got there.

The lady was quick to take our instructions, amid our panic and despatch medic, who arrived in good time. He approached us calm, collected and administered the appropriate level of first aid. Unfortunately, we had to go to A&amp;E in Mansfield. He gave us very clear written and verbal directions and the postcode for the hospital, even told us where the drop off and short stay car park were. The General manager also appeared and was sympathetic with words of advice. He asked security to open the top car park as quick as possible and told us the on-site medical team would ring in the morning and would see us of we thought right to do so. This put us at ease as much a it could considering the situation. Upon our return, we were told our check-in would be delayed for 2 hours and any hire bikes were to be taken back at our convenience with no extra charges.

Best decision ever.After queuing like good British people in the sweltering (and somehow always surprising) heat of summer we arrived at the check in and were met by a wonderfully kind representive who walked us through what to do next. As we made the drive to the lodge the children were on their best behaviour, quite incredible. On to the lodge, firstly those key bracelet things are fantastic, I want one for my own house, who needs normal, standard, boring keys? Anyway,the lodge was pretty damn great, good size kitchen and bedrooms were comfy, as was the sofa.We melted into the tropical pool every day, marvelling at the sheer amount of flesh on display. We juggled the children with our friends so that we could manage to sample some of the rides and I can confidently say my stomach plummeted through the planet when I went down 'The Cyclone' backwards. Both the pool and the park was enough to completely wear out the children and ourselves and I know I speak for us both when I say we can't wait to go again, especially as the children grow older. As we went back to our lodge every night met with that incredible view, with squirrels, ducks and deer visiting us I felt like I was in a picturesque heavenscape with Disney type animals surrounding me.

The dog friendly accommodation, which we always book and have never had issues with at other locations before, was filthy, with tatty decor and dilapidated fixtures and fittings. If this were a property for sale, it would 'require complete modernisation'. Our bare feet were black within minutes of walking around our supposedly freshly cleaned lodge.The pool facilities were good, but were obviously old with rust, peeling paintwork and generally rundown.  The changing rooms stank every time we had the misfortune of using them.We enjoyed the Dining In meal and thought it relatively good value for money with decent portion sizes. Pancake house was expensive for the serving but the staff were lovely. Starbucks was our go to each day for refreshments and the one adjacent to the Pottery Painting was the best, in our opinion.Pottery Painting was, as always, enjoyable and therapeutic but the price per item seemed steeper than ever.We enjoyed a 30 minute Pedalo on one of the hottest days of the year thus far, but wouldn't have wanted to pay more than the ¬£13.50 charge for that amount of time.Breakfast at the Sports Cafe was extortionate and, although tasty, ¬£1.50 for a single hash brown from a frozen McCain's packet that costs ¬£1.60 from supermarkets was pure greed.  We wouldn't eat there again.The signage was confusing, the car park an absolute maze and the cleaning staff were lethal as they thundered past us on their bicycles eager to leave before anyone challenged them on their poor efforts!

Needed a 6 bedroom lodge and a cot bed but they said we needed an executive lodge to have 7 people (even though we'd emailed before and they said you didn't need an upgrade if you have 6 people and an infant). Manager is a complete and utter tool and made out like we were in the wrong for THERE mistake. Centre Parcs are just money hungry. I enjoyed my time while I was there but every activity you want to do there costs an extra amount of money (apart from swimming). Want to do the go ape? ¬£31 per person and with 6 people able to do it, it's a no from me. Laser combat? Just as bad. The only cheap thing we could do was swimming and golf and golf was still ¬£6.50. I enjoyed my time there when I got in but staff are rude and ignorant and I can see why with a manager like that! The pancake house is a must.

We stayed in one of the rebfurbished woodland lodges which had everything we needed and was just big enough for the six of us.  We saw plenty of wildlife from our lodge which kept us all occupied - ducks, geese, squirrels, stote and deer ventured onto our patio! We were in lodge 323, which was only a 5 minute bike ride from the centre. A couple of us had an evening in the spa which was brilliant, lots of different themed spa rooms.  We nearly fell asleep on the water beds and loved the ice fountain, brilliant for after the saunas. Good value for money and it wasn't too busy, which meant we had some of the rooms to ourself. Definitely recommend it, plenty to do, nice accommodation and it only has to be as expensive as you make it when you get there.

Having stayed at Longleat (which we loved), and Woburn (which was a little underwhelming), we were really pleased with the size of the sight at Elvedon, and since I am the one who pulls my daughter in the bike buggy, I was really pleased that it was fairly flat!!Having previously stayed in executive lodges, we decided to book a standard 2 bed lodge. I have to say that having done so, I don't think we will spend the additional money to go executive again. The lodge, though smaller, was perfect for our needs.The local wildlife (which was sadly lacking at Woburn) was excellent at Elvedon. We had many visits from the local ducks, water birds and squirrels, but the most exciting was a young dear who visited a couple of times.The on-site facilities were great. I think the pool is the favourite of the three we have visited. The kids pool was definitely the best so far, and it was brilliant to see our two year old gaining in confidence everyday on the slides.We did a number of children's activities (football, plate painting, roller scating, a pony ride and the mini captain adventure), all of which were well managed and our daughter loved all of them.There were a couple of negatives. The restaurant booking system is a farce. Going to a restaurant at 6pm when you haven't booked a table, and being told they can't seat you for dinner, even though all but one table was empty was a joke. I get that there may be bookings later in the evening, but to not be able to offer a table until 2 hours later is ludicrous.The other thing was the amount of nettles in the woodland. I appreciate that they try to keep it as natural as possible, but I was constantly on the look out for them so my daughter wouldn't get stung.Overall though, it's huge tick for Elvedon Forest.We were exceptionally lucky with the weather, and with the combination of a great site, and gorgeous sunshine, we didn't miss going abroad at all!",0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0
groupe_5,First trip to Center parcs Sherwood Forest and although I can say we thoroughly enjoyed it the standard and cleanliness of the cabins are not up to scratch.  Our bedroom floor had bits of crisps on it when we arrived . We saw the cleaners as they were there when we arrived. Mid week all the cleaners did was refold our wet towels and put a triangle corner on the loo roll. They hoovered the living room but the whole cleaning process must have taken 10 mintues maximum.  Although the size of the lodges is good the beds are so uncomfortable as are the sofas. My boys really enjoyed the swimming pool but when I took my baby there the changing rooms were chaotic and a lot of them stank of urine! The jardin des sports was fabulous though.  Cafe rouge on site was great and staff really lovely.

groupe_5,"I was adamant after experiencing the worst holiday ever at Center Parcs Elveden last year that I would never return or venture into another one. Fortunately a couple of issues arose from my initial plans of taking my family to Tenerife, we decided to then stay in the UK and do a little round trip. My daughters begged to go to Center Parcs as they wanted to cycle on their bikes but we were all still a little apprehensive of going into the pool after one of my daughters fell ill from the water and had to be taken to A&amp;E and placed on a drip. We decided that we didn't want this bad memory for our daughters to continue as they really used to love going, so we thought we would venture out to a different location with hopes that we could put our previous bad experience behind us and we are so glad we done so!We had an absolute brilliant time in Sherwood. All the staff were extremely friendly which added to this experience. We had an executive lodge with a sauna which was our morning ritual and we loved it.We were close to the car park out of the way and most probably could have left our car outside of our lodge the whole time as it was secluded.  The kids enjoyed all of the activities we had pre-booked especially the mad science, Pizza Making and roller skating. They especially loved the kids disco and made friends with a couple of other children.As stated before we were very apprehensive about going into the pool, but once we got in we all had a fantastic time and I think we went on everything available to us. The kids particularly loved the kids area and the dinghy slide. I even noticed staff checking the water occasionally which gave us peace of mind.The village square seemed a little cramped to me compared to other CP's we've visited and on a whole this seemed like a smaller CP, but this was not an issue at all. We had a nice (expensive) meal in Cafe Rouge the first night as we didn't want to cook that evening, but wished we had waited a day as on Tuesday's kids eat for free. (oh well next time)I can honestly say now that what we call the Center Parcs curse has now been lifted.The only off putting thing this time around was me finding a string of hair in my mouth whilst eating the peas from my fish and chips meal besides this all was great and we will definitely be back to Sherwood at least.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

To be honest the decor of whole lodge looked tired and was in need of being refreshed. We mentioned it to the cleaner when he came to check if everything was ok and he did offer to get someone to come and clean it again but when you just unpacked and have 2 little ones running around full of excitement we said we would do it ourselves as it would be done properly. We actually left the lodge cleaner when we left than it was when we arrived. Our holiday last year was at Sherwood Forest Center Parcs in the same type of accommodation and it was spotlessly clean.

The activities we have done have been great and well managed. The resteraunts and bars are also good and clean with good service. The take away service is also good, but can be not as hot as you'd like but there is a microwave. Have had trouble getting hold of champagne on site (yes I know bigger problems to be had) they don't stock many in the shop but the take away man rang round the bars and hunted one down for us.

They make a special effort for our little one leaving drawing packs and towel animals. One thing to note is, even though its no cars on site (apart from check in and check out day) so you can cycle around without worry. Great for learning toddlers, but the service vehicles do whizz about all the time and they are used to it but some are fast so just keep an eye on the little ones.

However, having looked at the prices, we quickly cancelled that reservation and went elsewhere.I'm not daft, I understand there's a mark-up with such a captive market (see Parc-Market prices), but for me, the prices there went way above what should be classed as acceptable and CP are taking liberties.The service at Bella Italia and Hucks were poor. At Bella Italia, the staff looked as miserable as sin, and could barely raise a smile throughout the night which was a shame. And as for Hucks (on the Thursday), it wasn't exactly over-flowing with bookings, yet we still were made to wait almost an hour for our food (main course) and then there were things they didn't have some of the things on the menu - why not have a board up saying what's sold out? Just poor, slow service and I've come to expect more from Center Parcs, it felt like standards were slipping. We weren't the only group to suffer from the poor standard of care.Service is paramount, I feel like they're becoming a little complacent and take their customers for granted.You pay a premium at CP, you pay for the privilege of being in such an environment, but I feel they need to raise their game if they're to keep repeat business which is key to their on-going success.",1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,

We attended in the summer holidays this year which we thought would mean every where would be over crowded and exceptionally busy but actually we didn't have any problems with crowding or booking reassurance. The swimming pool could be busy at peak times which is to be expected. Our lodge was lovely, and there is so much to do that you can keep the kids occupied for days without booking any activities, however we did book a few in for our 5 year old.My only complaint would be the wasp problem they seem to have and that the swimming pool changing rooms smell a little like urine.

groupe_5,"Just returned from a four day break with family. Check-in was very simple and didn't have to queue for too long, you take the car to the lodge to unpack then drive it back to the car park. We stayed in a standard 2-bedroom lodge in Birch which was very nice, modern and clean with a well-equipped kitchen area. We hired bikes for the duration of our stay which was ¬£30 each, a little pricey but worth it when you're constantly travelling from place to place. Everything is pretty close together considering, and the general areas are all very tidy. We had booked a few activities before arrival. The first night we did the family quiz which was ok value for money, however the Sports Caf√© where it is situated is ridiculously priced, think the cheapest pint was around ¬£4.50! We booked table tennis which was also at the Sports Caf√©, this was also good fun. The next day we had booked crazy golf, again this is a good family activity. On the last day, we booked an electric pedlo on the lake through the activity centre, this was ¬£20 so not bad when there are a few people. The other two in our lodge also did the wildlife photography session which they enjoyed and got to keep their photos. The Subtropical Swimming Paradise was great fun, lots of areas to go to with water slides and rapids and it's also probably the only activity there which is free! When booking activities beforehand, most of them were booked up so we were surprised to find that there was good availability whilst we were there.We booked Bella Italia before arrival (¬£5 deposit each deducted from the bill), the service and food were both excellent here. We also went to Caf√© Rouge for lunch one day and the food wasn't badly priced but service and food were very mediocre. There are two Starbucks on site, this chain is already ridiculously priced but prices were bumped up even more here! The shops at the village square are also extortionate in prices. We brought our own food with us but we did need to top up on a few items. I suppose it is to be expected but seems cheeky to bump the prices right up considering the cost of the holiday/activities. Overall there is a lot to do here activity-wise, on the other hand it is very peaceful if you just wanted to relax, with nice walks and views. The staff overall are very friendly and go out of their way to help you out. It is great for a family break, we didn't have children with us but there is a great deal for them to do. I would highly recommend bringing your own food due to the high prices. We also brought a couple of disposable BBQs which was lovely for the summer evenings.

Looking around it was very noticeable that the cleaning hadn't been done to guest standards for a long time. As a four night stay costs over ¬£1000 we expected it to be a lot more presentable as previously stayed at worbun  forest and longleat which we highly recommend. We were so disgusted, dead flies on the windowsills which were also full of dust, stains all over the rug, food of some sort down the side of the coffee table, thick hair and cobwebs on the runner of the patio door, crumbs, dust and what looked like leaves on the floor by the radiator. These are just a few of our findings. Took photos on our phone, went to guest services, they made a note of it. On return to the villa there were a number of staff in there cleaning, in my opinion all of this cleaning they provided us on that day should have been done prior to our arrivel. Guest services apologised but the only compensation offered was an ¬£80 meal coupon. Another problem we faced was a locked safe when we arrived, tried to contact security, no answer. Again had to contact guest services and were told security would be there within the hour, waited other a hour and a half, fed up of wasting our day , security didn't come so we went out.

groupe_5,"I've never done a center Parcs holiday. What I was expecting was a massive forest and just lots of outdoor space to enjoy. Whilst the site is large it doesn't take long to walk around and you can't leave the parc so you're probably going to want to do more than just walk or cycle whilst on your break. That's when it all gets really expensive. There are 200+ activities on site but you could easily spend a few hundred pounds per person keeping yourself amused if you wanted to do a few during a 4 day break.The pool is free. It's great for the kids, and indeed was full of kids. It's mainly a fun pool fairly shallow with a wave machine, a few slides etc. Nothing for a serious swimmer though which surprised me and not very relaxing. If you have kids they will be amused for hours for free though!Laser clay pigeon shooting is good fun but again not cheap. Badminton courts can just be used by anyone if not booked, so chancers can get that for free potentially if you're lucky. We booked and had to kick people off.The shop is basically a well stocked convenience store with prices to match. It's not cheap but if you just use it for the stuff you forget it's fine. I didn't think the restaurants were expensive. Pretty standard prices. However because we'd read reviews saying they were costly we bought enough food to eat in. The breckland apartment are lovely. Kitchen is well equipped with dishwasher, wine cooler, coffee maker etc. The coffee machine capsules were replenished every day, so was the dishwasher tablet. Maybe we were lucky as there seem to be moans on here about that.  Only complaints are that all the doors slammed shut so lots of banging! Also the TV- old tech hotel TV just a few poor quality channels not even free view. It's not the sort of place you go to watch TV but if you want something to watch, take something to plug in via the provided HDMI cable!Really enjoyed getting on the bike to get around. The breckland apartment is not far from the center so ignore those comments. Many of the lodges are further, but it isn't within the woods.I imagine it's a great break for kids as they can just be left to do their own thing without worry. For us though, renting a lodge in the country and a few bikes would have been more varied and cheaper. Enjoyed the break but probably won't do it again.

The beginning wasn't a good experience - the website should be so much better, massively short on info. Sorted an online booking and the page to take the debit card crashed. Called them in the hope that the booking was on their system unpaid but no had to start at the beginning again, glad my memory worked and recalled all the details. Later tried to complete the entry for family names etc only to find that my name as the Lead Name had been put against the villa instead of the room - another call only to be told that the system would crash if they attempted to change it and it didn't matter which name was entered where - what would happen in an emergency with the wrong names entered against accommodation?   As novices, what should we take/not take? - website no help at all so as usual rely on Google. Come the day and coincidentally one side of checkin and son the other - system couldn't cope with that so the lovely lady at our window had to go to her colleague dealing with my son to try and check in - the name prob arose - had to be sorted as myself &amp; son would have only had entry to the wrong building, so it could be sorted correctly after all, without the system crashing!  Nice to have a colour coded map of the site, obviously need good eyesight with 400 acres compressed onto A4, but it works which is more than can be said for site signage. First problem, we had booked the Foresters for the first evening meal. We had expected it to be in the village along with the other eateries but no it's part of the Country Club (approx half mile away) and no map or sign tells you that! - we did find it after asking the way a couple of times but somewhat later than our booked time. Large scale map boards are around the site but only saw one with a 'you are here' - not much help when you're completely lost! - actually saw signage for the village to the left and to the right - surely it's not that difficult to get signage right after all these years?  Our room in Breckland was excellent and fitted out to a very good standard - coffee machine and a USB point didn't work - no one check these? No questionnaire No means of leaving a note No one care? Recycling/Rubbish bins everywhere apart from Breckland. Next thought - How does check out work? Absolutely no information - again surely it's simple to leave an information sheet in the room?

In my view you should only be able to bring them on in an emergency.

This was the first time we have gone as a couple, without extended family, and we chose Sherwood as they have one bedroom lodges.We paid for early arrival but as we got there at 11.30 this was slightly wasted! We were delighted to find that our accommodation came with parking, so we were able to leave the car virtually outside our lodge and start to enjoy the day and not have to worry about moving the car later on in the day to unload (they don't have this on the website so a big surprise!)We headed off on our bikes to the village square, which compared to the other Center Parcs we have been to felt a bit claustrophobic with everything quite close together.  We went to Dexter's for lunch - bit disappointed - it felt very dark and gloomy and the service was very slow - I wouldn't recommend it.We then found the amazing beach/lake area - the nicest of the CP beaches we've seen and did our first activity - the electric boats - which was lovely - you get half an hour which was long enough for the size of the lake. Our second activity was badminton (which we did twice in total over the week) - the sports hall was very warm!Other activities we did over the course of the week were field archery, laser clay shooting, falconry and Who's Out After Dark (evening nature walk). We enjoyed them all, but particularly the Falconry (Zac who led this session was brilliant) and the laser clay shooting.I also visited the salon in the spa for express paraffin wax treatments for my hands and feet which was lovely - this area was busier than when I went before for an evening treatment, so if you prefer peace and quiet and fewer people around I'd recommend the evening slots.We ate out a lot - Hucks (who have just changed their menu but I preferred the old one), and Rajinda Pradesh  (delicious, but if you are hungry or have a good appetite, don't decide to share rice or naan as the portions are smaller than in a typical Indian restaurant) for evening meals, and breakfasts in Foresters, Cafe Rouge and the Pancake house. If you think you might eat breakfast out then I'd recommend the breakfast vouchers you can buy as it adds up (you can't use them at Pancake house thought)! We also tried going for a drink at Foresters after our evening nature walk, but it was closed - the app says it closes at 11 but it actually closes at 9.  We had 'Dining In' on one night (takeaway delivery service), which, while tasty, had smaller portion size than you'd usually get when ordering a Chinese/Indian.The lodge itself was a two storey one bed - open plan downstairs with lounge, very small kitchen area (it would be difficult to cook a full on meal - the work surface is so minimal the toaster is kept in a cupboard) and a table and chairs. The sofa was a decent size but very low to the ground making it tricky to get up from, so we both ended up fighting over the slightly higher armchair.Upstairs you walk immediately into the bedroom (there's no door) which was a reasonable size, and the bathroom was huge as it runs across the width of the lodge.not sure of the point of the hydro bath - it's so noisy when it's running it does not support any relaxation! We deliberately chose an end lodge, which I'm pleased about, as the sound proofing between the lodges was minimal - seemed worse upstairs than down. I'm not sure why they allow people with small children to hire these lodges - they're really not big enough and it meant that our lodge wasn't as peaceful as it could be.We had the usual patio area which was lovely - we were visited by lots of creatures over the time we were there.People complain about the prices at CP - it's all there on the website though, so look before you book!

The lodge wasn't as clean as it could have been and looked like the cleaner could have done with a little more time to thoroughly clean. The single beds are tiny for adults and the kitchen is compact with a tiny fridge and an antiquated oven. The woodland surroundings are well kept and the children aged 2 and 4 loved exploring and riding their bikes. All the activities are well run but are expensive. We booked activities when we arrived and had no trouble getting days/times we wanted, but if something is a must it is worth booking before you go!

However, if you have an impression of secluded log cabins on a country estate with no near neighbours you would be disappointed. The ok but very busy swimming facility was virtually the only activity that was included in the price. Everything else was extra and pricey. The weekend was heaving with additional guests and there was no attempt to prevent the idiots who ignored the no cycling areas, particularly Lakeside, where our very young grandchildren played. During our week there one main direct path to the centre was closed for over 3 days to allow for the erection of an additional support mast for the zip wire and tree activity. This required a diversion adding another 5 minutes on to the walk, a big deal with a toddler.

groupe_6,"Just back from a week in Sherwood. Previously stayed at the Whinfell village a few times recently, but the kids are now confident on bikes and Whinfell is a 'bit hilly' so decided to visit Sherwood as seemed to be flatter according to reviews online. Was a bit worried as a few negative reviews on here, but went for it anyway - and am posting my first review to out a few things straight....Both villages are excellent. We all thought Whinfell has the better pool at present, but this will probably change next year when the extension is complete at Sherwood. Our kids are 5 and 6 - at Whinfell, the pool seems bigger, and the changing rooms are bigger - the kids can go on the rapids, and there are more areas of the pool for them. At Sherwood there are more slides for the younger ones, but the pool is less interesting - this will change next year with the extension. The pool is only one aspect of the holiday though, and Sherwood has a lovely feel. The staff are all brilliant, everyone is friendly and cheerful (same in Whinfell) - which is a massive achievement for both villages - I've tried to look for the mardy staff member, not for a whinge, but as more of a challenge, and have failed :-). Sherwood is indeed flatter and better for young ones on bikes, has more trails, and just felt better - probably due to the nature. Sherwood is greener, lots of different trees, Whinfell due to location is a bit more rugged and wild. Whinfell however is good for older ones as the terrain is more interesting. The lodges in Sherwood are more 'hidden'.There are lots of comments on here about Sherwood being too full / over developed - this is incorrect, we stayed in the school summer hols, in a heatwave and it did not feel full. The newly developed lodges 'look new' and are not deep in the forest, but then again they are up to date, and see plenty of light (whereas those deep in the forest do not) - horses for courses and in time they will be surrounded by trees. Cleaniness of accommodation, lovely and clean, our housekeeper (Nicola) was loved by the kids as she listened to their chatter, and then left behind Elephant and Swan towel models which blew their minds. Off road discovery, Mini captains a blast. Ate in Bella Italia (excellent), Forresters Inn (not so good but nice staff and location). Overall - yes it's a but pricey compared to a cheap flight abroad and hotel - but - what price is the smile on your kids faces flying around the woods on bikes, surrounded by ducks, squirrels, and rabbits - having the time of their lives, in a wonderful relaxing loctation, with staff that are happy to be there - full of smiles and chat.Would I recommend Center Parcs - massive yes. Sherwood or Whinfell - both great. Will we go back - you bet.Positives - everythingNegatives - NonePs - the pool redevelopment at present - other than seeing a picture on a fence, you are not really aware it is happeneing.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,1.0,-1.0

groupe_6,First impressions as always. Clean well presented. The lodge was clean and tidy on arrival. We were missing a tea towel which guest services sorted out after a phone call. They were busy but we did get on that evening. The staff were friendly and engaged positively with our family which is always nice to see. The food at Bella italia and foresters was good. The one big thing I would like Cp waiting staff to be updated with asnit happenednon more than one occasion. Is that when arriving HOT food. Don't put it in front of the 5months old baby who wants to grab it. They will burn themselves!!!! I had to reiterate this to a few man era of staff. Rajinda was good as usual. Curry could have been a bit warmer in temperature as it was a little on the warm side for my liking. The pool was clean but my only complaint is more family changing rooms would be a big help. The activities we did pottery and bowling was fun and the staff were nice and informative. Yes the pottery is a little expensive but we like it. We staying in lodge 858 cedar. Which is one of the new lodges. We liked t very much my only biggie was it is right by the delivery entrance and early morning a few lorries go past. Next time I'd book a little more further round the corner. But it didn't spoil anything. We got to use the medical centre unfortunately this time. Nanny fell of her bike quite badly and have to say the staff were excellent. They got her to the centre checked her over ( by a qualified nurse) patched her up and sent her on her way. Apart from a very sore leg and bruises she's ok thankfully. The staff were excellent who looked after her. Top marks for that!! We would definitely come back as we like what's in offer for young children. Would like the parc market to be better. The fresh food is always awful!!! And expensive. We always bring our own as it invariably is off before you get it back to the lodge. CP would totally benefit from a branded supermarket M&amp;S or a Waitrose would be much better.

groupe_6,We have just returned after a night stay. We have previously stayed at the Whinfell centre Parcs and wanted to try a different one.Personally we all preferred the lay out of whinfell better.This time we took our dog which was great although it meant your accommodation was on the outskirts which we enjoyed as it meant it was more quite. My complaint to Center Parcs are the dogs exercising areas were too small we choose to walk our dog through the forest on the outskirts. My recommendation to Center Parcs is to add some dog poo bins to the woods and maybe give dog owners a common sense set of rules to abide too whilst there for example clean up after your dog as we saw several dog poos in the forest just left. Keep your dogs on leads. Twice our dog on lead was approached by two different dogs that ran up to it off the lead which was very stressful as our dog does not like other dogs. (Once was when we next to our accommodation.) A downside to taking a dog is it limits your accommodation choice although the accommodation we stayed in was lovely.Now on the positive the kids loved completing the aerial course and the zip wire at the end. We all loved the aqua jets we booked. The kids loved the pool but wished there was more slides but centre Parcs was busy building/adding on to the pool whilst we were there. And there favourite part was the rapids. (Note these rapids are strong and you have no control and sometimes end up going into other people. There is a lovely cafe within the swimming pool area which does basis food and drinks but  please note they all accept cash and card. We hired bikes as didn't not have the room to bring 5 bikes and we glad we did especially being on the outskirts we used them all the time. We had a fab family week together and plan on visiting other centre Parcs to see what they have to offer. ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0,1.0,-1.0
groupe_6,"This was our first time at a Centre Parcs and we weren't sure what to expect. Overall we were very pleased and would probably go again. Here are a couple of key things we would have found helpful to know:- The (basic) woodland lodge was very good, a nice size, clean (the floors could have done with a mop though so take slippers!). A dustpan and brush would have been helpful.- You can only use disposable BBQs on the 'private brick built BBQ' so take some with you as they are expensive on site! (we had assumed it would be ok to use charcoal based on the description)- Our woodland lodge had a cafetierre not a Tassimo coffee maker as detailed (I looked into this in advance, bought special coffee pods and it was a normal cafetierre - would have been great if we'd known!)- Guest services were generally very helpful and responsive, however they did leave a broken bike outside our lodge for our whole stay, despite us ringing for it to be removed! Good job we didnt have our own bikes on this break.- They claim to be a dog-friendly holiday venue, however I do no agree really - especially if you also have children. We paid an additional (expensive compared to other holiday venues!) ¬£60 to take our small dog, however there is no private / walled garden and dogs are not allowed in almost every area of the site - apart from roads, paths, a couple of eateries and a few 'dog exercise areas' some distance from everything else. I might not have minded this so much if we hadn't been charged so much for him to join us.This made joining in any activities on arrival and departure day impossible.- I was impressed with the sturdy wooden cot with a god mattress, already in the lodge, this was great for our 2 year old.- You do not need to book activities in advance of your trip, as the marketing emails suggest.

We stayed in an 'executive lodge' in the area called maple.The lake was through the trees about 20 yards away and at this time of year we had a non stop succession of ducks, moorhens and geese all with chicks in tow.  The babies were very excited by the very close proximity of these birds as they watched through patio doors or had their dinner on the patio.also had rabbits, squirrels a small deer and a weasel (think weasel, not stoat).We needn't have spent anything as the terrific pool areas could easily have been enjoyed all day.  Definitely recommend taking plenty of own food if you want to economise as shop quite expensive.When we visited before (pre children) we ate at the Indian restaurant which was good.  This time my daughter and husband went there whilst I babysat and were very disappointed by the slow service and food that tasted out of a jar rather than cooked Indian style - only complaint of the week.Also ate lunch at pancake house, cafe rouge and hucks during stay.  Though not cheap, all staff were lovely, the food was decent and all had soft play areas for the children.Can see this place will be enjoyed by my family for many years as there will be so many 'exciting' activities for the children as they grow up - though grandad will need rests as a lot of walking - by my standards!Lovely having the roads safe to cycle on - though one service vehicle travelled a bit too fast.Weather was perfect which always helps but had it been poor we would still have had a good break.Can thoroughly recommend this centre for families.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1,1.0,1.0

All the facilities were great, except it was disappointing that they do not supply any bedding for their cots. We went to the Messy Play session, the toddler football, the soft play and Mum went for an overpriced massage at the spa! All the sessions were good, especially messy play. The football was not quite suitable for 18-month-olds as stated. Mum said she felt really pampered at the spa and enjoyed her massage.There was a lot of walking to get to the main centre (especially as the main walkway nearest our cabin was closed due to tree trimming), so I would bring a comfy lightweight buggy or hire a bike with child seat. There are a good range of restaurants and two Starbucks cafes - the nicest one overlooks the beach.There are a couple of good parks for children and the swimming pool caters for all ages with its slides, tubes, rapids and swim areas.It was lovely seeing all the wildlife around the place and my daughter enjoyed watching a family of Coots, and feeding geese by hand outside our cabin. Basically it was a lovely holiday, which all felt a little overpriced, but catered for children and kept us all busy each day.

It was only 2.5 hours away which we thought was just a nice distance.We arrived on the Monday around 3.30pm. Was expected the queue to get in to be massive but it wasnt at all. We was seen very quickly and got given our wristbands. We stayed at the new Waterside Apartments and was allowed to drive up to the location to empty our car. My first impression of the room was wow! We walked in and there was a travel cot and high chair already in there. The room was made up lovely and couldn't believe what was included - ie a tea towel, dish sponge, dishwasher tablets, hair dryer etc. The room layout was really good and the bedroom size was big. The view outside on the lake was amazing. We also had a resident peacock sat outside our window. He was in the area throughout the time we was there.We was about a 5 min walk away from the Pool and main reception and restaurants which was ideal. We pre-booked our evening meals and paid the ¬£5 deposit p/p which was then taken off the final bill. I would suggest booking as on our last night we didn't and each restaurant was quite busy and had a long waiting time.Unfortunately our little one was too small to get on a bike but this would be the ideal way to get around the site. Couldn't believe how many people was using then. Plenty of places to secure them up to.We went to baby sensory on one day, this was ¬£8 per baby for 30 mins. There was plenty of interaction with baby along with stations of lights, noise, mirrors etc. Just a shame it wasn't longer.We also went on an electric boat around the lake. This was ¬£21 for 4 persons for 30 mins. Was a great experience and a lovely first for our little boy.Lots of walks and other activities to do but unfortunately our little one was too young for this.The pool was very nice. It was very busy the first day and the prams were being stacked up outside in the main area. This was a worry for me as I was just a little worried about leaving my pram there. There were hooks that you can secure your pram to if you have a lock but on this day it was so busy we struggled to find a space.

When we were checking in they gave us a teddy bear and badge for my son and When we got to the villa there was a balloon, birthday cake, candles and a lovely happy birthday message on the black board. My Son wore his badge to his birthday meal in Hucks diner and he was treated like a VIP. He got a free mocktail. He got a card and a toy motorbike from a staff member. My hubby wore the badge for his birthday lunch in Forresters and he got a free dessert with a candle in it.

I even emailed Center Parcs to ask if this was true, but didn't get a response. Fortunately, I decided to just go to the bike centre and ask myself, and of course they had loads for hire. The bike people were fabulous. They made some adjustments on my youngest son's bike (which we had brought ourselves), and while we were waiting we saw them fix a wheelchair, replace a punctured inner tube on a buggy, and pump up the tyres of two different people who had their own bikes. All without charge! They were so helpful.We were allocated Maple 582, which was in a fabulous location - so close to the centre. Unfortunately, the smell of damp and mould was pretty strong, especially in the bedrooms. It might have been that, or the perhaps they had had a dog in there, but my asthma was triggered and I struggled to breath for the whole stay. We tried to stay out of the lodge as much as we could. The lodge was ok apart from that, but there were signs of wear and tear all over - stained cushions, a light out in the kitchen, a missing chair from the patio, mould in between the tiles in the bathroom. The subtropical paradise was great fun, but also a bit grubby looking and I found it chilly (my kids didn't, though).Generally the staff we encountered at the activities were great - friendly and welcoming - and we had an especially good experience at Rajinda Pradesh, although Bella Italia wasn't so good.

I had to leave at one point as couldn't breath. Layout of the changing room was also not good. You had to go into one changing room after another before you could get to the pool. Lodge also needs updating as very dated in my opinion.Won't suggest going to Cafe rouge. We ordered 3 Sunday roasts for adults at ¬£23 each and 3 children version at ¬£10 each but staff didn't explain the menu to us properly and charged full adult drinks and desserts on children meals despite clearly ordering from the children menu. Bill came to ¬£170. Shocking! And the food wasn't even that great.  Although manager came to explain bill however should have mentioned to customers about additional charges and choices on children menu. Quite misleading in my opinion.  Won't recommend going back there again! Overall a very pleasant trip. CP is a wonderful place. Planning of our next year CP trip already.

groupe_6,"Just got back from my first trip to Center Parcs (a day early I may add). I had heard good things so me and my wife booked a Mon-Fri trip for us and our 2 kids (22m and 9m). All I can say is that the whole place is very u201caverageu201d at best and definitely over-rated and over-priced. That's how I would sum it up, it's not horrible just very average.Firstly we had a swarm of flying ants hit our lodge on the first day which was not nice with 2 little ones but hey your in a first so show some sympathy and understanding. The issue is how their customer service dealt with it! We called and they literally asked us to go to them (meaning us dragging us and our babies across the village inconveniently) to collect some keys and view a new lodge they offered which was smaller and further away so a downgrade if anything. I therefore took it upon myself to try and clear the ants ourself which all I all wasted about 3 hours of our holiday! They sprayed the lodge later that day but this did nothing. The issue was not the ants but the way it was dealt with, one customer service agent patronisingly asked if u201cwe were from an urban areau201dAssuming we were naive to wildlife etc... Obviously this put a dampener on the start of our trip but hey we got over it and got on with our holiday but still the whole place is just very average in our view. I expected the whole place to be very well kept and picturesque, it's not! Don't get me wrong it's not dirty, just very worn and dated. The view from our lodge just looked dusty and full of geese and swan poo! I expected to sit out at night with a log fire and be in a beautifulForest setting.... we have a better experience in our garden! The lodge is practical but again very worn and dated! Had to re clean a lot of things ie utensils, didn't even use the high chair for our little one. Luckily took our own!Then finally we ate out twice at Hucks and the pancake house. Again don't get me wrong we didn't have a bad meal, just 2 very mediocre meals! Pancakeswere greasy and bacon wet and fatty (should be crispy with pancakes in my view). Hucks I had the platter and all the meat was very dry and flavourless, would have cooked it better myself!For the money we paid, I willBe going abroad next time.Really don't get he hype.

We was infested with ants in the spare toilet and in the garden.Very little wildlife.When I picked my baby's toys off the floor I caught a glimpse of the mess and dirt under the sofa.

Hucks was lovely,Emma was so helpful.Sadly the play area within Hucks was small and boring. The pancake house was understaffed and boring. At Sherwood it sits over the lake, you get given drawing activities and the fish are jumping out the water.

After careful consideration and the fact we had just unpacked 4 people into the Lodge we declined but were then offered some activities, I guess so the least time spent in the Lodge the better.

The next morning (Saturday) we headed to Guest Services for the children to choose some activities and for the team to come into our lodge and treat the ant infestation and put a dehumidifier in our bedroom.

We did and it was lovely but we had a huge tree right outside pretty much blocking the views (however you could still view this perfectly fine)The one thing i would say if it bothers you (and it didn't us) is don't book this IF you don't want to be woken up in the mornings by the ducks :)They get very chatty!When cooking in the apartment always have the extractor fan on FULL and open your balcony door so the fire alarm doesn't trigger! On the web it stated that this room had a chalkboard but there wasn't one. There is plenty to do and if you are taking kids - amazing but it is expensive all round. There is no denying that.

The lodge was really excellent with loads of space although sadly we were told we couldn't allow an additional infant (there would have been more than enough room). Anyway that person came in on a day pass and still got to eat and swim with us. The setting is lovely, pine trees and you do feel set apart from the rest of the world. Squirrels and rabbits hopping about all round the lodge, a bbq, sauna, pool room and mini cinema all added to our sense of luxury. The main pool is a little odd as you have to fight your way through changing cubicles to get to the poolside but well equipped with family cubicles and playpens. The toddler pirate pool was great.

We were given lodge number 73 Maple, which was a nice quite little spot. They informed me that we could take out car straight to the lodge and leave it there until it was clean and ready. This was different from the two previous occasions where we had to leave the car on the carpark until gone 3pm, so this was a nice easy start to the trip. Luckily the weather was lovely on day one so went to the beach, where we spent hours playing and my daughter loved that she could paddle in the lake.Lunch we nipped into the on-site supermarket and brought some food from the hot counter. This was a good option as 5 tasty chicken nuggets and potato wedges were only ¬£3.50 compared to a waffle and ice cream at ¬£8+. However - 2 cartons of OJ and 4 pints of milk racked up a massive ¬£8 Once we got into the lodge it was clean but looking old and tired. Only complaint was there aren't enough towels or loo role. That evening we ate at foresters inn, I had a chicken burger it was reasonable, but my misses raves about the curry. Service here was brilliant and polite and my daughter liked the play area. The following day my daughter had her hair braided, the member of staff who did it was again polite and helpful, my little one loved the braiding and it's still lasting. She also went to the pirate and princess party where we left her for 3 hours peace, she loved it and the staff where excellent and professional to the end. The last two evenings we ate at Hucks American bar and grill, food was reasonable and plentiful but the play area was great hence why we went twice as my daughter made friends on both occasions and really enjoyed it.All in all a good stay but at the rising cost I think we will be abroad next year ",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1,0.0,0.0

groupe_6,"I first came to Centre Parcs (Sherwood Forest) in 1989 for a weekend break with family. I have to say; at that time, i was impressed by the very thought of the freedom to loose yourself (and loose your tiny chalet) in the midst of a huge forest bang in the middle of Nottinghamshire whilst the world around you raced on. It was great, with the few ammenities that were essential for families; a couple of eateries and bars not forgetting the indoor tropical themed heated swimming dome; great fun.!!  Since that time I've been fortunate enough to have visited here quite a few times and witnessed the expansion of this site from the snug tiny villas to the tree houses and more recently the new builds that now cover what was once a decent sized golf course; villas bytheway that are more representative of properties from a well known 80s american horror movie.!.... and this is the point I'm making. It appears to me that the building of villas has run away with itself its created a nightmare for parking and an unbelievably overcrowded swimming dome and is close to becoming more representative of a holiday package that you would find abroad. That said the staff at Center Parcs and the cleaning staff are extremely helpful with a very positive attitude. It would also be great if some of the &quot;not so cheap&quot; villas had hot tubs; aswell as the the very expensive ones. Unfortunately i now feel that the very point of a holiday in sherwood forest is close to being lost, its expensive; and possibly out of reach for a lot of people and will no longer be a small &quot;village&quot; surrounded by forest but a forest surrounded by villas.!",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,1.0,-1.0

We always take our own food and bikes if we can and have main meals and picnics but it's still nice to go out for a treat. There's a wide variety of activities but it can make it a pricey weekend..... Thankfully the pool with brilliant slides and fun for all ages, is free. Building new accomodation means increases in people and cars and parking was an issue but this is being addressed with more facilities being built including a new fabulous (hopefully) extension to the pool.

The activities are amazing and being in the heart of nature was breathtaking. We sat watching geese ducks rabbits and squirrels in the back garden. Now for the down side which proved to be a very very big downside for me. My mother is aging and not particularly mobile. On making the reservation I was assured that there is a courtesy bus which could pick her up and bring her to join as at our activities. But in fact in reality it is one security van which is booked on a first come first served basis and has very very little availability (or hours and hours of waiting which is not practical as you don't want to plan each day right down to a T. ) My poor mum spent much more time in the lodge than she would have liked.

The lodge was lovely, clean and well kept.We never used the steam room and sauna, but made good use of the hot tub, which we all loved. There was a slight issue with it over flowing one evening, but a quick call and maintenance were over within 30 minutes. The games room was a welcome addition, and although my son and husband are keen gamers, we never turned on the Xbox through lack of time. The pool table was fab though. A couple of cues were missing tips, but again a quick call and someone came round with them.Well equipped kitchen, just lacking a chopping board. The cleaners forgot to leave toilet rolls, so we called and some were dropped off.We ate in two nights with the dining in menu. The food was lovely, pizza and Chinese. A couple of items were missing though, but once again nothing a phone call didn't fix.Lots of activities were taken up by us during our stay, quads, junior quads, the drop, laser combat, archery, aqua jets, zip wire, treasure hunt and quiz night.The guys running the quads were fantastic, as were those doing the zip wire.The treasure hunt was fun.The pool area was amazing. The kids could have spent all day in there. The rapids were not working the first two days, but we made up for it the remaining three we were there. The cyclone was loved by most, (although I was terrified), the rapids, slides, children's area and wave machine were just brilliant.The changing rooms were sometimes a little dirty, but mostly because of people leaving nappies, tags, wet wipes etc!!

groupe_6,"This was our first time visiting Center Parcs and were shocked at how big it was. Our party was two adults so cannot really comment on children's activities. When we first arrived we were asked to park at our lodge which took a while to find but could not go in till 3pm. After 3pm we unpacked and then had to return the car to the car park.I highly recommend hiring bikes as you need them to get around everywhere quicker. However the bikes are not the best quality. They work well apart from the squeaky brakes. We heard several squeaky bikes on our trip. Center Parcs can be quite expensive so i suggest bringing your own food as much as possible and limiting the number of activities you buy. Also i advise booking restaurants for evening meals well in advance as they get very full on the weekend. The activities we did were field archery, quad biking and segways were by far the best and easiest to learn as a beginner. Its a shame there is not different levels for activities like beginner and intermediate as on some of the activities were difficult to learn when other people already knew what to do. . The lodges are quite basic but provide what you need. It was just a shame that on our last night the tv and wifi did not seem to work. Our lodge was 278 near the car park which was quite easy to get back to on an evening as it was not far from the village square where most food places are. The subtropical swimming paradise was great apart from how busy it was. I expected this in the summer holidays so made sure we went swimming from 5pm on wards when it is quietest. The main slide the grande cascade was not open when we visited as there was building work on it which was a shame. The best part was the hot pool outside which was very relaxing. There is lots of lifeguards everywhere so we felt very safe. On checkout day i recommend getting up early to get the car from the car park to avoid the queues. We got the car at 8am and had to return our bikes then as well. At 10am we returned the car park which was very busy and we struggled to find a space. Next time i would take the car back at 9am when everyone else is collecting their cars to pack. The check in and check out days are a bit mad with so many people doing the same and lots of cars everywhere. The other days are really quiet as no cars can leave the car park.

groupe_6,Returned again after a few years break. We stayed in an executive 2 bed villa and was pleasantly surprised following all the negative reviews I had read beforehand. It was clean and well appointed (tassimo coffee machine and wine cooler) with no obvious appearance of wear. The only minor issue would be that the bedrooms could do with blackout blinds meaning we woke early. We contacted guest services about new batteries for the TV remote and they were changed before we could return to the villa. We also contacted security as we locked ourselves out of the safe and they arrived within minutes so very impressed with the level of service.We decided to keep our bikes in the villa at night which was a bit of a squeeze but this ensured they were safe.The cost of activities is ridiculous (as we knew from previous visits) so we chose to spend our time swimming and cycling and enjoying the forest. We did eat in Bella Italia and Hucks and received good service and good food in both but this was our only 'extra'.Cost is really the only reason for not giving 5 stars as ¬£600 for just 50 hours in the park is a bit steep.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0

The accommodation was showing signs of wear and wasn't the cleanest on arrival. The previous occupants had left a packet of wispas in one of the cupboards - we were happy about that! The twin room had a definite smell of damp in the corners but the double room was fine. Decor just seemed worn and tired but they are slowly reburbishing these.  The house keepers arrived at lunchtime on three of the days and we always had lunch back at the lodge to save some ¬£'s. We sent them away as it was a little intrusive to have cleaners in while eating. I wouldn't pay for the housekeeping next time because of this.We are out at Hucks for my sons birhday. The service was very slow and they were very busy but the food was tasty (and expensive). Pool area was good as always but other activities are overpriced. Streetcars was only about 20 mins in the car!! My son had only just got the hang of it and it was over. We built a habitat box (Melissa and Doug one) that you can buy for ¬£8-¬£10. They charged ¬£28 for the time it took to put it together and partially paint it. There were clear instructions to follow with the box. ¬£28 way too steep!Quad bikes were good fun but again a lot of waiting around in the time allocated.

We liked this apartment as it is at the far end away from everything. its right by the Spa and the Forresters Inn. Its about a 15min gentle stroll into the centre.When we walked into the room it still had that newness about it and the view looking out over the golf course is amazing. also plenty of deer to spot in the evening!We did look at the new waterfront apartments, which are where the old hotel used to be. The ones that face the lake do have a good view. They are quite near to the lake and also near to a path so you do get people going past. Word of warning the STUDIO ROOMS, which arent self catering dont back onto the lake. they look out onto the forest....well it will be a forest once it grows. At the moment they look out onto a road and a few new villas....not very private! our friends stayed in one and were disappointed in their view and even more so when they came to our apartment!Nothing much has changed. You can now play football golf in the afternoon up by the golf course. that was quite popular and theres also football pool which is where the golf simulator used to be. We noticed that there is NO MORE riding on the cyclone as a FOUR. its now only for 2 or 3 people. and word of warning IF you are a large adult going down with a small child, check that you are allowed to do this BEFORE you queue and climb the 8 flights of stairs. we saw some people being turned away at the top due to &quot;weight&quot; issues!We used the spa 4 times. twice having treatments and twice using the spa. we also ate at the Vitale cafe. could not fault it at all. For us this is our treat now. it was also nice to chill out there and for the girls to come around with things for you to try. i was offered a face mask and hand cream and also a little drink and a cereal bar. We ate out three times having prebooked forresters inn twice and prebooked the Rajinda Pradesh.We love the indian and the food could not be faulted but the service let it down this year. Our order was taken and we got our drinks then we were simply &quot;forgotten&quot; we waited ages for our popadoms. some people didnt even get theirs. it was a shame as it wasnt even busy. The star of the night was LINDA our waitress. She has been there for 20+ years and it showed. She worked her socks off trying to make sure every table was ok. We had a little chat with her at the end of our meal about &quot;old times&quot;. she more than made up for us having waited.We also ate twice at the Forresters. Was gutted to see they werent doing the ribs anymore. The first meal we had there was ok. My daughters boyfriend had a cocktail and at ¬£11 we all thought was a bit pricey but the meal was good. the second time we went was the last night. boy was it quiet but the service, again, was so so slow and when our meals came up there were little bits missing and the waitress kept coming up with little pots of things! To be honest it was a little disappointing. we paid a fair bit for the meal but it just lacked something this year. For us center parcs is still our yearly chill out treat. we saw deer everyday. and a trip each day to the bird hide was a must. i saw two birds, a nuthatch and a tree creeper that i have never seen before and lets not even talk about the wrens. people who have recently been to the bird hide will know about the wrens!There is so much to do here and for all ages. there are things to do that you think &quot;how much&quot; and things to do that are simply FREE.

We arrived about an hour early than check in time (3pm) and decided to have a walk around before being allowed into our 2 bedroom executive lodge. Our first impression was it looked great, that was until we arrived at our Lodge. As the gate to the lodges isn't open until 3pm the cues from the car park are manic, only one way in so be prepared for a wait.  Walking up to our lodge we was greeted by a large full rubbish bag outside our door. This had been left by the housekeeper. Walking into the lodge we had more rubbish bags and so it went on. The main bedroom had not been serviced as the throws were literally thrown on top of the bed the quilt was dirty and had no quilt cover on. The windows and mirrors were dirty and the living room was infested with ants. We eventually got moved to another lodge after being told they were full.  Surprising after saying we wanted a full refund and weren't prepared to stay the original lodge. I thought that the lodges looked tired and need of a little tlc. The windows all look like they have a lot of decay and probably need replacing. We had to asked for a kettle. The rooms feel damp and the extractors don't turn off until you hit the isolator switch. Flat screen tv's are tiny. The tropical swimming pool really needs cleaning as it is showing signs of age. The hot whirlpool are ridiculously not whirlpools only 2 were working out of 4. Changing rooms were dirty along with the whole feel of the place. We tried bowling ridiculously expensive ¬£31 for an hour????Crazy golf ridiculously expensive ¬£13.50 for 2 adults. To be honest everything is overpriced for the time given. Will need to remortgage. Cafe Rouge was serving afternoon tea which was lovely. The Indian was a huge disappointment. All in all think wisely if this is what you want to do but was not the place for us. The forest is lovely but continuous sounds of fighter jets taking off from the airbase next door spoils the experience.

In addition Fraser working in the swimming area was polite and offered much needed advice on mermaid photos.. honestly cannot fault the staff within the swimming pool apart from the lack of lifeguard on the smaller slide in the pirate area.

Our lodge was on the outer edge of the park, which suited us as it was really quiet and plenty of obviously well fed geese squirrels and moorhens came regularly to check if we had any goodies on offer. It was a good 15 minute walk to the main Village Square, but the Foresters Inn and the Country club was only a short walk away from our lodge, which was handy if you wanted a short trip for food and drinks out. This area of the park also had its own parking area for the executive lodges which was very nearby and saves the long walk back after parking the car in the main parking area. My husband, a keen mountain biker, enjoyed being able to cycle into Sherwood Pines, which is very nearby, a track just off the arrivals area takes you straight there with no roadwork needed, so very safe route for kids. My two teen sons enjoyed the swimming pools and slides. Although there was work ongoing to build a new area in the pool, this did not interfere at all in our stay. They were not working on it over the weekend so it was quiet, but Monday there were the sounds of drills etc so that might be annoying if you wanted to sit and sunbathe in peace outside by the water rapids.There was lots to do in the main Village Square and I liked the layout as it never felt overly busy although the park was sold out.We didn't do any activities (other than the family putting) as we had planned on a cycling and swimming weekend to keep costs down, but the treetop action challenge and the zipwire looked amazing.We ate at cafe rouge and the pancake house. Both were excellent. Cafe rouge worked out at about ¬£25 per head, so not the cheapest dinner out, but was what we expected as its never cheap to eat in Centre parcs. The park market shop was well stocked and similar prices to a local one stop or co-op type place, so again was as we expected, but there is a Tesco and Asda a short drive away if you wanted to stock up on cheaper food. We probably would have done that if we were staying longer.There were lots of ducklings and baby moorhens around the entire park, which were very cute. The main lake was very pretty and the boating activities looked fun although we didn't participate - we were very tempted though.We all really enjoyed the weekend and will most definitely be back.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,1.0,1.0

We pre booked and ate in a couple of restaurants which again the staff were so polite, friendly and accommodating towards us. We were situated by the play area on one evening and the waitress recognised we had no children with us and moved us to a quieter part of the restaurant (not that we minded at all)We stopped off at the supermarket off site prior to arriving, as we had guessed the on site supermarket would be expensive, however we were pleasantly surprised as it wasn't too expensive at all. I found it strange that the place has 1000's of people in and you hardly hear any noise only the rustling of the animals in the forest and a few bikes whizzing past you whilst you walk through the forest.

Although the water park was nice and clean, there was nowhere to just go for a nice swim. The outdoor section seems to have gone now and the pool area itself is tiny. The side pool was being used for activities so there wasn't anything for a pregnant woman to do really. I would have loved a little swim without fear of being kicked in the belly.

It's disappointing that the main pool doesn't open until 10am, 9am would be better to make the most of the day especially as there are now more people wanting to use the pool. Also, it'd be good to see the lockers updated to use the wrist bands like at Woburn. Finally, our executive villa is now looking rather tired - we book the same one each year but the exterior wood needs varnishing, the sofa cushions are very squashed and flat so hard for elderly people to sit on; my mother is unable to sit on it at all as she can't get up from it easily as they are so soft and just squash right down providing no support.The gem though was the lovely housekeeping staff who, as always, were professional and friendly.

When you consider the price compared to a holiday cottage, it's worth remembering that you don't need to pay to go out anywhere else for a day.  Taking several people to a leisure pool of that quality can be very expensive and yet you can do it every day for as long as you like.

Let's not get started on the premium added for a weekend stay! We had booked exclusive mon-Friday but my birthday was Sunday so hubby rang and amended to our usual Executive but for a week. No one explained that executive now stretched to three ranges and payment options. Needless to say we arrived (unknown) to; damp, musky, paint peeling off, settee covers threadbare and stains on the living room mat! Mould spiders etc... my entire birthday ruined. A CP inspection concurred our opinion that this was not acceptable and we were offered ¬£200 on a total cost of ¬£1100+ cost. My daughters spa day was ruined sorting it all, but that is the ONLY decent thing they did which was to refund half the cost of her day at the spa; my actual birthday. The day after my birthday I got a birthday bear, Small prosecco and chocolate.!? They have not taken into consideration the fact that such a landmark family moment was entrusted with them and they reacted so cold and clinically. I've received compensation before, once not even asked for. ¬£100 for noise from the erection of the Exclusive range..yet ¬£200 for the complete ruination of such a family occasion? We have holidays booked we are giving our children...we will never go back. Money can't replace their attitude or lack of empathy. Advise.....check and double check your accommodation before you go. Not everyone stays in like we do I accept that. But we do. It's smelly and awful despite the spray and candles. NOTE; we were offered to move ON my birthday, day to an unrefurbished 3 bed. Why? The spa cost ¬£300 because it was a Sunday on top of the ¬£1100+ existing cost. Read my reviews and you will see praise. This is not sour grapes.

groupe_6,"We were in the fortunate position that our children were given an additional week at May half term and having been told by others we would love it, we looked in to Centre Parks. We hadn't had a holiday for over 4 years and the kids were all geared up to go. As first timers, we decided to go along and see what it was like first before we started booking activities. If you want the kids to be fully entertained the whole time, be prepared to pay a small fortune for it. Just one activity each per day for my two would have been anything between ¬£20 to ¬£100 per day. That's if you didn't have to pay for the supervising adult too. Also, the age categories meant that there wasn't many things both my children could do together which made it a tad more frustrating.We were fortunate to have a lodge not too far from the main hub. Had it not have been, I probably would have wished we had bikes. If you can, take your own. It is a huge expense on top of an already expensive holiday. Approx another ¬£100 for 4 bikes for the week for us.I cannot fault the comfort of the lodge nor the housekeeping.  The housekeepers did a fantastic job and after a small accident from my youngest, bedding was replaced, no questions asked and a lovely note left for her . All staff we encountered in and around the village were polite, helpful and seemed to like being there, unlike other holiday park staff I've met previously.Personally, we would have to plan and budget much more if we were to go again. It is certainly overpriced if you were to go during school holidays as it's still pretty pricey for basically accommodation only for a normal week. We didn't eat at any restaurants purely because of the expense. We could have easily spent an extra ¬£500 in 4 days just on an activity each, a bike and one meal out. Be prepared.  The shop is a bit more pricey but not too great that it felt a rip off. No different to a petrol station forecourt shop. Take what you can in advance, make the most of the amazing swimming pool, parks, beach, lake and walks. We packed a lunch each morning and gave the kids a &quot;treat&quot; allowance each day. We were lucky with some great weather and extremely friendly deer and squirrels.

Unfortunately one member of our party has mobility issues and uses a wheelchair but there was no way of getting the wheelchair to the front or back door.

With the holiday costing over ¬£1000 we were disappointed with the standard of accommodation, hired a woodland Lodge, but the radiator in the bathroom didn't work, so therefore we had no way of drying over swimming clothing, one of the beds wasn't made up for arrival.

The accommodation which was nearly ¬£1000 (yes it was during the school holiday but expected better) the villa was tired &amp; dated sticky &amp; dirty wooden floors, worn &amp; marked mat &amp; furniture. Was disappointed with the standard. Food outlets were charging a la Carte prices for pub food, I do expect to pay more as you are a captive audience &amp; know there is a choice to cook / eat in, but if prices were more realistic would probably entice more people to eat out.  Pool was busy no changing cubicles available, there was black grit &amp; sand in the bottom of the shallow end of the pool, not nice for the little ones.  Standards of cleanliness all over the parc was lacking, tables not wiped / cleared also some of the toilets. They keep adding more accommodation but not expanding other areas, part of the pool was closed off for a new ride being built, but very little extra seating, it was packed and uncomfortable not a very relaxing experience. I believe there is a new manager at Sherwood?

On the whole we had a fabulous weekend, the lodges were perfectly located close to the centre, but quite well shaded in some very warm weather. The lodges were lovely, clean and well equipped. Our baby granddaughter loved watching all the animals from the patio window. We all had bikes and it was good to be able to cycle round the Parcs, our granddaughter really enjoyed riding round on the back of her dad's bike, in a safe environment. She also enjoyed the baby dolphin swimming session in the half hour before the pool opened to everyone. The Baby Owls experience was also a big hit with both baby and parents. We had ordered a premium Chinese banquet for the evening of our arrival. There were 5 adults, but we could only order in even numbers and had to choose between 4 &amp; 6! We ordered for 6 and it was way too much food, ordering for 4 would have been plenty, particularly since the quality was not great. We also ate at Cafe Rouge, where the food quality was good, but the service terrible. In Hucks food was good and service excellent. The Pancake House won the stars from us, food was excellent and service outstanding. Two of us visited Aqua Sana and found it absolutely outstanding. We had been before, but not since it has been refurbished, the improvement is massive. It was a fabulous experience and we would love to go again.

groupe_6,"First of all, we had a great summer holiday together as a family. We've been to Center Parcs before so knew what to expect, including the prices. What lets Centre Parcs down badly is the extortionate prices. Some examples include:~ ¬£80+ to hire 3 bicycles~ ¬£10+ to hire a badminton court (without equipment)~ ¬£8.50 to hire an American pool table~ ¬£42+ to use the spaNow, Center Parcs will tell you that free and unlimited entry to the Subtropical Swimming Paradise is included in your holiday price, and so it should be! There is no need to charge such hugely inflated prices, which increase at peak times such as school holidays. If the cost of activities was kept under control then more people would use them, and have a better holiday, and would return year after year instead of once every five years or so. This pricing structure is very disappointing, unfair and totally unreasonable.On the plus side, the estate is clean, tidy and well maintained. There is a real sense of safety wherever you go. Arrival and departure arrangements have improved since our last visit but you still get the odd idiot who thinks the rules don't apply to them. If you stick to the instructions and follow the rules, everything works well and everyone remains calm! It's only when you do your own thing that the system falls down.Our accommodation was great. We opted for a refurbished lodge and the daily cleaning service which was very good. Unfortunately, our holiday was in the 2018 'heat wave' so there was a ban on bbq's due to the dry land. It was cool to have the ducks come and visit us on the patio, which everyone enjoyed.Top Tips:~ Don't pay for early check in, it's a waste of money. You can arrive at anytime on your arrival day, park up and use the facilities until your lodge is ready at 3pm~ Don't pay to pick a particular lodge, unless you are very fussy. The automatic allocation system works fine, but if you really must be in a certain part of the estate then go ahead.~ Take the basic foodstuffs with you. The mini-mart is well stocked but can be expensive. To be fair there are some good offers.~ If you can take your own bike then do so. The hire bikes are ok but it can get expensive for families.~ If you want to play any sports then take your own equipment, such as badminton kit, tennis rackets etc as these items are charged to hire in addition to the cost of the court.Would we recommend Center Parcs Sherwood Forest? Yes. It's our favourite and likely to be the best one there is.Would we return? Possibly.Do we feel ripped off? Definitely.Could Center Parcs do more to deliver cost efficiency?

The birds (swans, geese &amp; ducks) we couldn't keep our patio door open or even sit outside due to the overwhelming number of birds that appeared each time we opened the door (we never fed them). Aqua jetting- my son only got to use the jet for 8mins out of a 30 min session. Laser combat- was over attended, my family have done this activity every year and there has only ever been 24 people max, but at Sherwood this time there was 39 people at one session &amp; it was the worst experience, as there isn't enough room to run about and hide properly, it was over priced and also the playing time was severely reduced because of the volume of people.We always do target archery as a family of 4 but the price would have been over ¬£100 this time and is not worth this expense. We were very disappointed. The subtropical paradise had limited use due to works being done on all flumes this was a massive issue for us as it's one of the reasons we booked Sherwood Forest instead of our closer CP in Penrith. We should have been informed at the point of booking and we wouldn't have travelled all the way to Sherwood. The tv in the villa had a shockingly poor quality picture. Where has badger watch gone? As we have been going to CP for 16 years now we have definitely noticed the difference in accommodation and pricing. Our new woodland lodge felt like the old comfort plus.

So many to choose from! Loved the new mermaids and sharks. And with a photo to take home included in the price was brilliant. Climbing activity was great! I wish I caught the woman's name who was running the activity on Wednesday 18th July (blonde hair), she was fantastic with my 5 year old Rosie and encouraged her to reach the top. So good.

As expected it was extremely busy as peak season, the price of the Lodge was reasonable and all the facilities good.My only issues were with hiring a trailer for the bike. When pre booking two adults bikes to hire upon going to the Cycle Centre we were told no trailers were available and we were put on a waiting list. No option was given for the trailer online and a staff member said this was due to them all being reserved, although the booking platform did not give any information about this, I presumed there would be many available. I was told hopefully one would be available on Tuesday or Wednesday and luckily we did receive one on the Tuesday. If one didn't become available this would have impacted our break as would have been a trek to walk to the Village Square so for some families who didn't receive a trailer this could have impacted their break. My only other issue encountered was PAT testing was being done at the Lodges, we were in when the door knocked and let the electrician in. The site is secure but the same as you would be at home you can be suspicious and there was no advanced warning this would happen. The electrician said some people were not happy with them going round and they said they were not informed when arriving. We definitely were not told when checking in or no communication, I understand this needs doing and had no issue however if you were sleeping, putting a child down to nap etc it could be annoying and guests should really be told.Overall a great family break and brought back found memories from childhood I will be going again.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0

A couple of gripes were: Unfortunately when we arrived we were told all bikes were out of stock and even those who pre booked were turned away, whilst this wasnt the parcs fault (other gets hadn't returned their bikes at the requested time) it was frustrating.

I have since heard form others that apparently this is common.Also (more of a personal one) everywhere was covered in bark so for my crawling one year old who hates being in her pram it wasnt easy to put her down and let her play (even the kods parks)!

The basin tap in the en-suite bathroom only ran at a trickle, there was a brown lime scale stain in the toilet and the shower screen had thick, dirty looking limescale deposits at the bottom.",1.0,-1.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,
groupe_6,"As a family of 8 we visited this Holiday Parc for about the 5th consecutive year in a row. Whilst we enjoyed our Holiday, as we always do, it is becoming quite apparent that the Lodges in particular are in need of some urgent cleaning on the outside. There is considerable growth of plants also on some, which need pruning back. Large parts look neglected, where Lodges can barely be visible, behind large undergrowth. We were also disappointed at the poor selection and quality of food available in the Restaurants, with virtually no choice at all for Draught Beers.Entertainment at night is extremely poor for adults who want to relax after a hectic day and watch some kind of performance, be it a singer, or whatever.All in all, it is an expensive holiday, without variety for returning customers. It seems to be going through the motions year after year, without any real drive or imagination. School term breaks are ridiculously costly. ¬£2,699 for 4 nights in a 4 bed Lodge.I dont mind paying, but unfortunately it appears to be going downhill.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1,1.0,-1.0

The avoid overspending and arguments during the stay, we allocated an amount to both kids, to choose their own activities. I also purchased the breakfast deal which gave us some freedom to choose where we ate. Overall we had a fantastic time. The staff are great, especially the lodge cleaners who, although we never met in person, would leave notes and the blackboard for us. The lodge was clean, well maintained and ideally located next to a lake. The wildlife outside the Patio doors kept us amused with ducks, geese, squirrels, rabbits and a swan making daily appearances. The latter would even peck at the door for food! The activities were all well organised and enjoyable. We managed biking, quads, Segway, laser clay, bowling and geocache. One negative was the pottery painting, we booked the studio painting class only to find out after that there was considerable additional costs to buy the item you wanted to paint with no free option, not even a small plate or eggcup. We ended up cancelling this and losing the money. This could do with being clearer on the app. Will definitely make a return trip.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0
groupe_6,"DisappointingI write this review part way through our 5 day holiday to Sherwood Forest.We booked our trip having been very impressed with Whinfell Forest back in February. Upon arrival at Sherwood, we were informed there was a ban on BBQs due to the lack of rain.  An email prior to our arrival would have been appreciated given I had purchased disposable BBQs and food for a BBQ which I then had to try and cook under a very pitiful, luke warm grill in the kitchen.The lodges are really badly sign posted - we drove past our lodge twice when trying to find it.  The unloading areas are totally inadequate compared to Whinfel.  We saw a family get their car stuck whilst trying to unload their luggage upon arrival.We are staying in lodge 544, and were greeted with a quite overwhelming, damp smell which has now engrained itself into our clothes. The rest of the lodge was fine albeit a little bit tired.  The bathroom is in serious need of an upgrade.  The bath is completely worn out and the grouting in the tiles very dirty.  The outdoor area is full of poo (see pictures) and becomes overrun with birds whenever there is a sniff of food.  We cant let our 2 and 5 year old out of the lodge due to the amount of poo that surrounds it. Overall the lodge has a really uninviting and uncomfortable feel which is really disappointing given the amount we paid for the holiday. The leisure facilities are not as geared up towards the under 5s as much as Whinfell Forest.  The whole reason we decided to stay at Center Parcs again was because our trip to Whinfell was so easy and our 2 and 5 year old were kept entertained and occupied the whole time.  The play areas and the majority of the activities are not suitable for my 2.5 year old, they are either to old or too young for him. We are also disappointed that the swimming pool is partially closed due to refurbishment.  This was not at all advertised when we booked our break at Sherwood.  We definitely would not have booked had we known this. Overall we will not be returning to Sherwood Forest any time soon unless the whole place is given an enormous facelift.  Given we could have gone to Menorca for a week including flights and food for the same price as what we paid for just the accommodation, we have been left very underwhelmed and disappointed with our holiday.  I won't be recommending this place to anyone.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0

How can they justify the extra charge beats me. The only things that are free are the Pool and a couple of Play areas, everything else is expensive (even though mostly they are good). The Supermarket is very expensive as are the Restaurants (but why - they are only average). To leave was a joke if you are in one of the Lodges toward the exit as it is only one way for traffic which meant it took us 30mins to get to the exit to the Car Park in traffic after leaving our Lodge at 10am. I didn't see any advisers walking around to help with any questions you may have, and the maps and signs were not that good, and walkway areas that did not allow 'wheels' were poorly marked (why not have an obvious logo repeatedly marked in case you missed the one written sign at the beginning).We wanted to like it but came away thinking it could be so much better",1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,0.0,
groupe_6,"It is our first time to Center Parcs, and thought overall it was good but many things could be improved.   Mainly the information on how the parc works and the strict rules...  On arrival at 2.30pm the car park was packed, it took ages to find a parking space.   We then realised the vehicle gate had opened so drove to lodge.  The Information pack provided in the lodge is a little vague as states 'if you do not have an allocated parking spot you should return your car to the car park'...  this is confusing as our lodge like many others had a parking bay right outside and were unsure on whether this was an allocated space or not,  when asked was told, 'cars can only be left on village if disabled or other permission had been granted'.   Parking back at the main carpark takes ages as it's a one way ring road round the village, and finding a car parking space again took forever.     We hired 2 adult bikes the man serving us was quite grumpy, and had to immediately return 1 bike as the gears did not work..  therefore having to queue up again...  it would be a good idea to get your bikes as early as possible to avoid the queue.  Another rule is a sharp 10am out of lodge rule.   The cleaners turned up dead on 10am and enter the lodges to start work.    We headed back to the carpark but as a ring road system and only 1 gate in and out, we were stuck in a traffic jam trying to get out for 30mins.   A number of guests were stood on the side of ring road with all their cases etc waiting, but due to the volume of traffic the cars could not get to them to load up as they were stuck in the queue of traffic trying to exit the park...  thank fully it was not raining...   the information handbook does not make it clear that there is this strict departure rule of 10am nor does it state what time you can collect your vehicle to start packing.  The handbook needs to advise what time you can collect cars,  and that the cleaners will arrive at 10, and you MUST be packed and out by 10, and that you could experience long traffic delays when exiting the park ! Although all staff (Bar 2 -  the bike man and a lady running woodland wheelers) were very engaging and friendly, they were all running activities or at the specific desks in the village, you never saw any customer service people walking about on hand to help.    The supermarket is Very Expensive !  We brought all our own food and did not use the Restuarant's, again as reviews say they are average and expensive!  Activities are expensive (although good and varied),  you basically have to pay for everything, including shuttlecocks and hire of rackets.   Everything does get quite booked up.   We did manage to book a couple of things whilst there normally for the next day though, everything else we pre booked before coming. I was really surprised at how close each lodge is, there is no flat cleared space for your own games or leisure, and stinging nettles are EVERYWHERE.  There are areas which do not allow bikes (mainly round the village Center) however these are not very well signposted and easy to miss, again better signage would at least inform guests.   It can also be very crowded with bikes and although most people are courteous it could be very dangerous especially for those walking and children,  (there were a number of near misses)...  it would be an idea to have markings on Roads and pathways for pedestrian and cycle use so to help avoid accidents, and also ensure all bikes have bells, to make others (both cyclist and pedestrians aware you are coming up from behind) !

I am awaiting surgery, and another two in our party had medical problems  so couldn't walk too far, however we were told that we could ring security  and they would pick us up and drop off wherever we wanted to go. Three of us used this service, it was excellent and the driver Martin couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. He was so cheerful and made our weekend all the more a happy experience. Thomas was also very helpful.

This is a three hour drive for us so we thought we would do a longer break (Fri-Fri). We stayed in a three bed new woodland lodge and as always the accommodation was clean and fresh with plenty of amenities. I was surprised that it seemed smaller than the ones at longleat and also less supplies were provided (we are usually given extra bin bags, washing up liquid and cloths). My husband hired us two bikes and a trailer for our daughter which although expensive (¬£130 for the week) was worth it.Unfortunately, despite having pre-booked activities on the first evening our daughter developed a high temperature and was not well enough to do much for about 5 days. Centre Parcs were fantastic about this and not only refunded the full amount for the activities booked but also delivered a get well soon teddy to our lodge which made our daughters holiday. Small gestures like this are yet another reason why we keep returning.

All of the staff within the complex were great with children and always happy to help.Having had such a nice trip I do not like to be negative; however, there were a few points that I feel could be improved on:Noise - We had very noisy neighbours which was not helpful with a sick child - however, we did not report this so I'm sure if we had then it would have been dealt with.Signage - The toilets within the sports complex are not signposted very well and were very difficult to find, which unfortunately meant my daughter wet herself.Dining in - Being stuck in our lodge we treated ourselves to a curry from the dining in menu. This was not cheap at ¬£35 and it was not pleasent. My husbands prawns were not cooked properly, the rice was slimey and my chicken was very dry. We have fed this back but are waiting for a response.The Foresters inn pub - We ate here on the last day and the food was very expensive for what it was.

groupe_6,"We stayed Friday to Monday with our 18 month old daughter. We just went for the basic two bedroom woodland lodge (502) and it was absolutely fine for our needs. Really clean and tidy and a perfect size for the three of us. However the travel cot provided only had a very thin, hard base which was counted as a mattress. My husband spoke to Guest Services and they came and swapped it for a proper cot and mattress straight away. We ate out a few times at the Sports Cafe, Forresters Inn, Bella Italia and Hucks. They were all lovely, service was great in most of them. Foresters Inn was quite slow service, once we had eaten our plates weren't cleared and we had to go and find a waitress to pay the bill. Bella Italia has a great children's menu with lots of choice. There is some repetition across the menus of the Sports Cafe, Forresters and Hucks. So maybe a little bit of difference across these would be good? We went to the Pottery Painting Studio and the girls in here were so helpful and great with little ones too! We also did the Baby Owls activity which was great! A chance to hold different owls with a very informative and knowledgeable guide. The play areas and pool were great. The work going on at the pool didn't take away from the experience at all, everything is running as normal.

groupe_6,We have been going to Centre Parcs now for over 20 years with our children and have recently bought a dog.  We decided to look at centre Parcs for a short break monday to Friday.  After looking at recent reviews about pets we chose to ignore them but on arrival it was quite clear that it is not a pet friendly place.  The dog exercise areas were very small  and not very many throughout the park.  The lodge which was an executive lodge Oaks 571 which was dark dismal no windows at the front and was very dirty and smelly no toilet rolls or kitchen kit ie tea towels oven gloves cleaning pack.  Luckily I had plenty of antiseptic wipes which I used to clean up.  Went to customer services who did apologise but then tried to give me lots of toilet rolls and numerous tea towels. Went back to the lodge still to find that there was an awful smell this was coming from a dirty damp mop that had been placed in a clipboard which I then had to rinse out and place outside.  To finish us off on day 2 we were woken at 7.30 am by workmen working on the adjoining lodge this was the end of our holiday we decided to come home.

All events totally beyond their control (who puts nappies down the loos?).Everyone from the therapist at Aqua Sana who found my son sobbing on the road, to the first aiders, the nurses, the security guard who stopped and gave us a lift on our return from A&amp;E as we were gingerly walking back to our villa, the chaps who cleared the drains, the housekeepers who cleaned the mess up, the cycle hire who took the bikes back and refunded us as he couldn't ride anymore, to guest services who smoothed everything over -  were AMAZING. They were all so kind, sympathetic, and caring. Also intelligent service, they were able to make refunds, supply him with his favourite drinks while we were waiting for first aid without having to get management involved - it seems as if they give their staff a lot of autonomy which pays dividends.Whilst I'm not sure we would go back as a family on our own - I think that our children have outgrown it a bit - I wish we had been when they were younger and I would definitely recommend it for family get togethers.

The quads were great fun especially the adult ones where if the instructor is happy with your driving you are guided round the track at a fast pace getting the chance to really open them up.Family highlight was the Laser combat that far exceeded any of our thoughts and the kids loved putting the camo paint on and being part of team. The kids favorite was without doubt the Cable Ski,they were really struggling to get going and kept failing within seconds of the cable pulling them but the 2 instructors were fantastic with them and took time to build their confidence and explain where they were going wrong and eventually they managed it,the smile on their faces after was worth every penny.Swimming pool is fantastic especially the rapids but the wave pool didn't seem to last as long or as good as the one at Woburn which left the kids a little disappointed but they soon got over it..Only real negative from pool is the changing facilities that are very cramped and a bit grubby,changing area could do with a new refit with bigger lockers installed and more showers too.As we had stayed at other villages we knew to take plenty of food and drink with us as otherwise it can get a bit expensive,we had dinner out a couple of nights at Hucks and Cafe Rouge both were of a decent standard and at prices you would expect to pay on a resort.

The Electric boats were good fun, although we were chased to come in 10 minutes before we were due in which was a shame so found that activity expensive for what we got (the lady could have been a bit nicer about it too) and when we came in, no one helped the people in one of the boats out so they were left to fend for themselves!We spent a bit of time in the pool over the weekend - this is great fun and kept very clean.We had great food and drinks in the Sports Cafe where the staff were excellent, it was nice having somewhere to take our two dogs that we had with us and we could overlook the park for my nephew! We decided to take advantage of the hot drink and cake deal which was advertised everywhere at Cafe Rouge - that was a waste of time as they only had 2 cakes on offer out of a list of about 6 so would not do that again.

The bedroom at the front had looked like it had a hole that had been filled in and not painted over and the whole lodge did feel like it needed some TLC - I know that they are dog lodges but we do pay the same as everyone else, as well as extra for bringing dogs! It would be nice to have fenced in gardens for the dog lodges - we spoke to lots of people and this seems to be a much needed addition.

groupe_6,"We have recently returned from a week's break at Elveden Forest, and I am so disappointed in the standard of our accommodation and the cleanliness of the facilities. Having stayed at this particular Center Parcs village several times before, I decided to book a 'luxury' lodge this year for all the family as it was a special occasion, celebrating our Nan's birthday. First impressions on arrival, I was shocked at the standard of the lodge. On the website it states that u201cExclusive lodges are finished to the highest standard, with stunning interiors.u201d Well this couldn't be further from the truth!! The decor was tired, dirty and damaged, with peeling paint and wallpaper. The sofa was ripped in several places, the lodge smelt musty and damp, the carpets were filthy and worn, and there was broken glass in the living room, which initially my mum thought was a splinter. It wasn't until the second day when my husband cut his foot on it, that we realised there were still shards of glass stuck in the coffee table and on the rug! Having two babies with us, this immediately was a cause for concern as this should have been dealt with once the previous guests had left! There were cigarette ends and rubbish littered around the garden, patio area and the hot tub, and the outside furniture was broken and absolutely filthy!! I understand we were staying in the middle of a forest, but to have to wipe off thick green mould from all the chairs is just not acceptable. They clearly have never been maintained or cleaned!! The downstairs bedroom in particular appeared to have only had the bedsheets changed. The carpet and floors were dirty and there were poo stains in the ensuite toilet! To top it off, the wood burner in the lounge was broken and had not been fixed prior to our arrival.We visited the swimming pool twice every day during our break, and on each occasion the changing rooms were absolutely disgusting!! It didn't matter if we arrived when the swimming pool opened or in the late evening, they were filthy and it was apparent that they weren't cleaned! As this is the only 'free' activity in the village, the traffic of people using this facility is constant, therefore why aren't cleaners on site maintaining the cleanliness of the changing areas? On the third day of our break, we decided to go for a walk in the morning leaving my Nan in the lodge and my cousin asleep upstairs in her room. We got a frantic call from my Nan while we were out saying there was a man downstairs in our lodge and he was refusing to leave! We immediately rushed back to discover the man upstairs in plain clothing PAT testing the electrical equipment in our lodge. My husband politely asked him to leave as this was our holiday and we shouldn't have been disturbed without prior warning, and the man refused to finish his work as he had already started! My cousin was upset as she was woken by my Nan to find a strange man in our lodge who was refusing to leave! My cousin is a nurse and she works extremely long hours, so this was supposed to be a relaxing break for her. For her to be disturbed in the morning during her holiday is completely out of order, and to have an elderly lady frightened and feel unsafe is unacceptable. The man had let himself in presuming there was nobody in, despite us putting the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door!! When my husband questioned him he said he would have entered anyway even if we were not there and would have left a calling card. He had an unmarked vehicle and was wearing plain clothes, so the whole experience was really scary and completely went against any safety regulations. On every door in our lodge there were posters prompting us to ensure the doors and windows were locked correctly at all times for our own safety, yet here was this large, aggressive man contracted by Center Parcs to undertake PAT testing during a paying guests holiday! The laugh of the matter was there was a lightbulb out in the dining room, yet this had not been fixed before our arrival!! The electrician was understandably angry at Center Parcs for not pre-warning guests of the work he would be carrying out over the next ten weeks, but his manner was aggressive and confrontational and we did not feel safe in our lodge. My mum and aunt immediately went to complain and conveniently the site manager was unavailable. After this experience we decided enough was enough and we left the next morning, a whole day before our trip was due to end. I have never had a holiday like this and I am so upset and disappointed as this trip was our first family holiday with our babies and our Nan. We will not be booking a break with Center Parcs ever again, which is a shame as we have holidayed with them nearly every year, sometimes even going twice a year for weekend breaks. Anyone thinking of booking an Exclusive Lodge should refrain, they are definitely not 'luxury' and not worth the expensive cost!",1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0
groupe_6,"We visit Center Parcs every year, this year we had another member to add so was great to show him all the great experiences Center Parcs had to offer.We stayed in maple 621 and the lodge so so clean and smelt fresh. We had lots of visits from ducks and squirrels and was right near a lake and saw ducklings and lots of wildlife. We self cater so didn't eat out, we did drink in the sports bar, country club and the swimming pool view bar. Alcohol prices are high, but what we noticed was things geared at families where reasonable prices (I.e kids eat free, baby products in the supermarket) this is great and exactly how Center Parcs should be. We only done a couple of activities this year mainly due to having a small baby with us and not wanting to restrict ourselfs to timings. My 6 year old drove mini land rovers, which was brilliant and we hired pedalos! We always treat ourselves to swimming pool cabanas. Having small kids it's great to have a secure base and much easier for changing etc.. as we share the cost with family it doesn't work out to expensive. We visited the pancake house on our final day, brilliant service and yummy. Always sad to leave Center Parcs but roll on next year ",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0
groupe_6,"Came here in March with 3 friends for a girls weekend and then I booked and took my elderly Mum in April basically so she could sit with the wildlife outside the lodge.Both times I booked the basic woodland lodge and for me they are more than comfortable and adequate.More than one toilet roll would be a bonus, maybe the basics like a small bottle of wash up liquid as well as the 2 dishwasher tablets would go a long way and wouldn't break the bank, especially considering the price paid.No need for the executive lodges to some extent, you are in the forest, it's nice to have the rustic feel and I personally do not want a maid to service the room.The lodges are warm and cosy, the wildlife is a treat, all in all quite expensive but a very relaxing stay.The other thing I would mention is that I believe that the water park could do with being extended and remembering it's not just for kids, unless that is your future plans for families only. It seem that kids are the main focus throughout.The changing rooms for the water park are a bit of a nightmare! You can't find one and it's seriously a maze! ",0.0,,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,-1.0

The seating areas were much busier but always are. Lifeguards could have been more attentive around the rapids as some people struggled with strong currents and were ignored and a large group took over most of the outside pool area playing a ball game which was annoying not being able to swim and getting hit by a ball randomly.Food and service in all restaurants was good. Only other reason why I gave 4 stars instead if 5 was because the pony rides that my daughter does every year has moved due to construction and it was impersonal and crowded with the pony being led on pavement through lots of people.

groupe_6,"Ok lets start with the obvious Centre Parcs is not cheap in school holidays, but in the same respect nor is a holiday abroad for 2 adults, 2 teenagers and a toddler. However most of the costs are what you make it. We planned breakfast and lunches in our villa and one evening meal booked at Bella Italia. We pre-booked activities when they first became available and knew how much we spent/would spend roughly whilst there.We arrived on the Monday around 10am, wristbands were given on entrance and we easily parked. We started exploring as soon as we got there. We had hired bikes for the teenagers and could collect these from 11am, this again was quick and easy and bikes of a reasonable quality. They also supply the bike locks, we just took their own helmets. We got the car around 4pm and didn't have long to wait to get into the village, although parking in a layby nearby was a little bit of an issue due to the building work being carried out. We stayed in a new lodge and I think was very new. The place was imaculate, some kitchen equipment looked unused. Beds extremely comfy and again very clean. Yes, building work was taking place opposite but it didn't disturb us and didn't start until about 8, if anything toddler loved watching the diggers whilst having breakfast. The villa had everything u needed for a weeks stay and couldn't have asked for better. The chalkboard also a great idea so I could write what we were doing each day to keep a track on time etc. Heating also worked well and although on timer you could change it to whatever temperature you preferred. Heated towel rail great in bathroom to dry swimwear properly. Safe in the cupboard by front door if you need it.Animals and birds galore at patio doors in the morning, squirrels do like a monkey nut and birds and deer will eat bird food thrown out. Large disposable BBQ's fit the racks outside and lovely enclosed patio area, BBQ utensils were also provided in kitchen. Fire great on a chilly evening but logs seem to burn forever so do not light too late as one night we sat until 1am waiting for it to go out!Wristbands are provided for keyless entry to villa and pool lockers which is a great idea, you get a wristband per bedroom, therefore we had 3 but could pay deposit and get another wristband at customer services meaning we all (apart from toddler) had one and could come and go as we pleased, also lockers are not huge so in colder weather would have trouble fitting 2 peoples bags, coats, shoes etc into one to share.Be warned at low level light/evenings all the villas and surrounding look very similar and hard to get lost at first. Luckily we had trackers on our mobiles and could see where to get back to. Also the outdoor pursuit area where quads, laser etc is, is a fair walk from the villa so leave plenty of time. If you are sending teenagers on their own you can get disclaimer forms in advance and fill them out to take with them, rather than having to trek all the way with them, which we only found out after the first time!The pool was great, yes afternoons did seem busy but could still get a changing room, locker etc ok and queues for rides were not too bad. Used the pool daily and was liked by all. Shower/hair gel on walls by showers a great idea for after and regularly used these, found we also like the body dryers ¬£1 a time but got majority of 5 of us dry and quick and less hassle getting dried normally. Also spin dryer near exit 20p and great for spinning swimwear save dripping costumes and again quick and easily dried back at villa.Activities... teenagers took part in quads, laser, badminton and pool, enjoyed both and loved their freedom at centre parcs being away from the parents. We all had a couple of games of bowling, which is done by time rather than game and not much difference in price to our local alley. Pool tables ¬£1 a time and quite a few of them dotted about. Geocaching good fun for whole family and good way to see all the park. Crazy golf good and nice to have a family activity although was busy and did get held up a lot. Little one took part in the teddy bear picnic which was fantastic and definitely on his to do list again. Staff were great and all friendly and interactive with kids. Food outlets.... Starbucks, tried all 3 of them, all pretty much the same as any other starbucks but nice to get a proper latte whenever you fancy. Pancake house, divine huge pankcakes and filling, well worth the money. Bella Italia, prettty much same menu as home and nice, freshly cooked and loved the outside but undercover seating area. Dexter kitchen - wish we hadn't bothered. This was the only let down at centre parcs, we visited for lunch on our last day, a long wait for expensive burgers, which consisted of a small nearly cold burger in a huge roll which was pretty tastleless, chips tasted like they had been double cooked and sons hotdog seemed to be a tinned hotdog fried! Was awful and really disapointed at paying around ¬£50 for rubbish, especially as our last meal at centre parcs, but hey you learn so not to be repeatedOther areas, the playground is fun for kids letting off a bit of steam after swimming, Beach area nice and boats looked good although a little chilly whilst we were there, plenty of places to park your bikes, we took toddlers balance bike and lock and could easily lock up when we went swimming, meal etc. Little soft play area upstairs in sports area, little one had fun in there, shame there isn't a split level soft play area, tunnels, slides etc for children, as there is not that much for them indoors to do unless you pay and book in advance.  Bikes easily scanned back in at end of holiday and car loaded and returned to the car park so we continued to enjoy the park until leaving about 5pm. Will we be back... definitely and the kids are already planning next years activities. Little one will also be over 3 then so can enjoy a lot more activities to what were on offer this year. Can't wait, just a shame their return booking offer is only valid for 28 days as we can't agree holiday dates with work until 2019 starts!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0

Pay for experiences as that is why you are there in the first place, bring your own food as much as you can, bring your bikes or prepare to walk for hours.

So we had 3 bedrooms all with ensuites, a private sauna and whirlpool bath. Sauna was great, much bigger and better than I had expected, except some idiots had decided to write on the ceiling, whirlpool bath was difficult to switch on and no instructions in the lodge.

All very clean and tidy, no signs of damp or mould in the bathrooms, a slight smell of disinfectant but as dogs have been in there that is reassuring really!  The only down side of taking your dogs is that you cannot have the doors open and we had 2 days of 27 degree heat so it was a bit stuffy, you also have to walk your dog on the lead for every single trip out for a wee, which does get a bit tiring at 3am! Still our own choice to bring them along. The dog exercise areas have been improved with higher fencing and bramble clearance and they were sufficient for our saluki to have a bimble about and a quick run but we still didn't dare let the greyhound off the lead as there were squirrels and deer everywhere and she would have been over the fences in a flash - still adequate fencing for most hounds I should think.  Park standards were good, tidy and well kept. The swimming was excellent as usual, again, no sign of deterioration in the facilities, you can see that there is a programme of maintenance keeping things up to standard. Loved the rapids, the hot tubs (which you don't get at Woburn) and the main pool (also rubbish at woburn).We shopped at Sainsburys down the road after check in to save money (Parc Market is expensive, but we spent our &quot;come back soon&quot; vouchers there) but we did eat out at the sports bar (chips and cocktails) and Cafe Rouge. The meal at Cafe Rouge was odd as we arrived on Thursday evening and asked to sit outside, then waited about 20 mins before I went to fetch a waitress to get our drinks order by which time we were ready for food order as well, we then waited ages for both food and drink which arrived together. They had clearly forgotten us! The food was nice but the bumbling service put us off going back the next day for breakfast. Veggie choices are limited which surprised me as I thought that CP would have jumped on the middle class Vegan bandwagon - but they do have a habit of serving avocado with the veggie breakfasts for some reason.The wildlife is amazing we saw 20 different species including a stoat, heron, deer and the ubiquitous squirrels which drove the greyhound crazy!But my big tip is - on leaving don't go into the village for breakfast - get out of there and drive 300 yards down the road to Elveden Farm Shop and Cafe where they do a lovely breakfast for less money with less crowds and speedier service.",1.0,--1,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0

I now go off site to nearby Tesco who not only have reasonable prices but also have an outstanding selection of bbq goodies. Sadly CP don't. Our executive lodge with the price tag was poor also.

The rest of the park is great. The staff are absolutely amazing and helpful. I think CP need go rethink their prices in the restaurants cause the nearby options offsite are a far better far cheap option. Families on holiday are not always looking for high end restaurant prices but affordable meals to save cooking for themselves.

groupe_7,"Mixed review. This is my third visit to centerparcs so I know the set up now.First point - we are still unhappy about the launderette no longer being there. On our first visit in 2015 we found it really useful and most places of this size would offer a launderette. As a family without a car it meant we had to carry excessive luggage or pay their extortionate service wash charges. We chose the former.Our lodge was a little grubbier than the last couple of times. In the living area there were stains on wall and a broken biscuit behind a chair. In the kitchen there was a very dirty dustpan and brush but nothing terrible. You need to do better here Centerparcs.Bedroom and bathroom were clean.We found restaurants to be much better this year. The quality of food, length of time to be served and attitude of staff were all better than in previous years. Yes it's still expensive but we don't mind as much if we get the quality. We ate at The Forrester's, Huck's, Sports Cafe, Pancake House and Cafe Rouge. Sports Cafe and Pancake House did best for Vegan/ allergies with a dedicated menu. The Forrester's did worst. We were very pleased with the new play area outside at SportsCafe with a castle theme. Much better than before and my six year old loved it. He also did some archery and instructor Craig was very good and attentive to him (he is autistic). Big thanks to him.Swimming/changing areas seemed cleaner and less crowded than in previous years.We all had bikes. My seat was loose but I took it back and it was sorted out quickly and without fuss and the bike seemed a better quality this year.We were unhappy about dogs this time. One wandered without a lead alone and came and did it's business behind our lodge as well as scaring away some of the wildlife. After reporting it, a security man said he found the owner and spoke to them but the mess was not removed by anyone. Children had been walking barefoot there earlier that day so I was shocked this was not done. It took a second interaction from me next day (via Twitter) to get someone to remove it.We also saw another dog without a lead not in an exercise area onsite. You need to be careful with this Centerparcs. Please monitor this situation before it becomes a big issue. Seeing dogs chase the wildlife and fouling is a big NO.Our heating was not working but a maintenance person was sent out promptly and it was rectified without fuss. We were impressed by the efficiency of that.We found staff in the shops to be smiley and helpful. The outside areas and play areas all looked well maintained and inviting. We love the bird and wildlife hides.So overall I have given a 3* this year. I still prefer it to Butlins (where we also go) and my son adores it here. We love the wildlife, lovely bike rides and walks. We love the lodges. Just keep on making the improvements and keep your eye on the areas of concern please.

We had deer, squirrels and ducks. Ducks a little cheeky as would waddle in the room to look for food. Very relaxing place to stay. We did a few activities like crazy golf, horse and carriage ride and hired a boat but would need a fat wallet to do too many things. We were lucky as had good weather so spent several hours on the beach. Went to Ollys magical carvery on Saturday it was fabulous for all ages and the food wasnt to bad. If you like sweet stuff the pancake house is a must. fabulous pancakes and waffles. Cafe Rouge was good food but choice was limited. Foresters excellent with a nice play area for younger children.A couple of negatives the beach area is lovely to sit and chill but unless you are ready before 9 am to sit in the sun its impossible to get a sunbed. there were 10 beds for the whole beach. more beds and maybe a few chairs for people who cannot manage to sit on the sand would be better.

groupe_7,"My wife and I, and our 3 year old daughter stayed at Elveden forest recently in the Maple Lodges. The lodges themselves are very nice, and ideal for a short stay, beds are fairly comfortable, however the pillows are a little on the large side and my neck hurt after a few nights. The park itself is beautiful and well maintained and very catered for families. I wont go into too much detail about everything, my main point of this post is to highlight a few safety concerns I had whilst swimming...There is a small childrens swimming area off the main pool, which is kept lovely and warm. There is a small slide and a large slide to the immediate left when entering. Both have safety issues which need addressed and I hope Centreparcs takes my comments onboard. Being the ever paranoid parent of a young child, im always envisioning ways my child will manage to injure themselves seriously so Im constantly following her around making sure she is safe. The small slide is safe enough, however the tiles at the bottom underneath the water are quite rough and sharp on the skin, and my daughter often complained that they hurt her legs. I caught one child trying to go down face first and if I hadnt stopped her, I can only imagine the facial injuries this could have caused. What this slide needs is a mat under the water where the children come off the slide.The larger slide is my main concern, it has 2 potential safety issues. Again I made sure to walk my daughter up the 10 concrete steps and then make sure she got down the slide properly. 1) The concrete steps, if slipped on will cause injury to little children, although there is a lifegaurd on location, there is no one at the top to lookout for children falling down the stairs. One one occasion, i saw a child slip and crack his face off one of the steps. These steps, or at the very least, the edges of the steps, need to be padded. 2) At the top is the start of the slide, and there is another plastic step children must go up before they can sit down on the slide. I made sure my daughter got up this ok, and down the slide ok everytime. However on one occasion I saw the young girl next to me fall backwards, and sadly i couldnt catch her completely to minimise the impact her head had on the concrete behind her. She was gladly ok, but this could have been a SERIOUS head injury that could be avoided with 1 simple and very cheap add on - a thick padded mat! A mat would help prevent heads from impacting the concrete floor....Anyway overall, we had a very good stay at centre parcs and would definitely recommend and go back, but these issues need to be addressed.",0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,,1.0,0.0
groupe_7,"This was our first visit to Sherwood Forrest, having previously been to whinfell last year. We stayed in a newly refurbished 3 bed woodland lodge (221 cedar) which was located up a set of stairs. The lodge was clean and tidy, great for kids as patio doors opened onto a grassy patch next to small pond. Our little girl loved feeding the geese and ducks who never failed to appear at the sound of the opening door. Buy some bird feed/monkey nuts prior to arrival as they charge a premium in the shop. Slight issue with the lodge was it being at the top of stairs given we had a toddler who still uses a buggy at times. Not major but worth noting if you have a baby as husband had to push buggy up dirt track at the side. Also take note that there is no hand soap or fairy liquid provided (¬£2.50 for a standard Palmolive hand wash in the parc market) we also felt that we could have done with more towels as one each for a 5 day stay wasn't really enough.  As others have said the parc market is expensive for some items so try to bring the majority of your food etc with you but beware the fridge is a small under counter version. That said all food in the market was fresh and of a good standard if a little more expensive (think co-op pricing) Personally I didn't feel the restaurants were too expensive, pancake house is a must for anyone who visits. Starbucks has a 50p increase per drink compared to our hometown which I thought a little steep, not that it stopped me going. Activities are great, I was apprehensive having read about the work being carried out to the pool but it had no affect on our experience at all. 2.5 year old and 8 year old both loved the pool. Make sure to bring swimming towels of your own or it's ¬£2 per towel each time you go! We done the following activities toddler soccer, pony ride, archery, boat ride, laser tag and wall climbing. Kids enjoyed all the activities and all staff were friendly and helpful. Overall a fab holiday, don't let the bad reviews put you off, Center Parcs is essentially as expensive a holiday as you make it when your there. If you take all your own food and don't do any activities and just let the kids enjoy the parks, swimming and beach then you could spend very little while there. It's the activities that quickly add up (¬£20 for a 15 min pony ride)We look forward to returning again once the pool extension has finished as it looks fab.",1.0,-1,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

groupe_7,"This was our first trip to Center Parcs as a family of four and we had a great time. We chose Center Parcs after a wash out beach holiday last year so that we knew there would still be things to do to keep the kids entertained if the weather wasn't great. There is plenty to do here although we felt that there wasn't much our two children aged 3.5 and 19 months could do together; just unfortunate age gaping really. Some of the activities are also overpriced in our opinion for the time you get and if you want to do a lot of activities and eat out be prepared to spend a fair bit! We stayed in a new woodland lodge which was nicely decorated and comfortable although it could have done with a deep clean, especially the wooden floors in the lounge and kitchen area which left our socks and feet filthy in our first day until we scrubbed it down. I was glad I packed kitchen stuff including washing up liquid, cloths and tea towels as there were none and only a coulple of dishwasher tabs were provided. I missed having somewhere to dry clothes and towels, there was a tiny maiden and I was constantly rotating our towels on the patio chairs to get them dry as it was too warm to have the radiators on. We were located fairly near the main venue area where most of the shops and restaurants are so we didn't bother with bikes and walked around which was lovely, although we were lucky to have dry days so didn't have to worry about it raining. The only downside was trying to navigate the steep steps up to our lodge with a buggy. Checking in time around 3pm when cars are allowed into the parc to unload is chaos, we couldn't park up near our lodge and unloading a car full of stuff took us a while! Would recommend planning your first day to wait to get into your lodge till later if you can. We went to the pool everyday and our kids loved it. The kids also liked the beach area although it was a nightmare for us as they kept making a dash off towards the lake and it looked pretty grubby and there were a couple of dead fish on the shoreline! We ate in Cafe Rouge which was lovely, Dexter's which was good food if not a little expensive and the Sports Cafe which was ok. We picked up a few bits and bobs in the Parc Market which came in handy. I took enough food for breakfasts, a couple of lunches and a couple of evening meals and we couldn't have fitted anymore than that in the fridge. We couldn't get in Hucks for the early dining experience so recommend you book this early in advance if it's something you want to do. All in all we had a very enjoyable time and we will probably go back again although we will probably wait until our kids are a bit older.",1.0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
groupe_7,"We were lucky enough to spend Monday to Friday in June here with our children and grandchildren from the USA and Spain ages 4,5,6 and 7 so there wasn't many others school age children there. So there was plenty of activities for them to do without the need to book. We hired bikes and it was lovely to bike around the forest with no fear of cars and traffic. The pool area was amazing and not busy so there were hardly any queues for the slides. The kids and adults really enjoyed that. We had two three bed cabins next to each other and although on the small side they were very clean and well equipped and the kids enjoyed feeding the squirals and birds that appeared at the door every morning. All the staff were really friendly and helpful.  Everywhere was really clean and although I had heard the restaurants were expensive and busy we didnt find that at all and the quality of the food wasnt bad either. I had also heard the supermarket was expensive so we went to a Tesco 10 mind down the road to stock up but there was no need. The onsite supermarket was very well stocked and not too expensive at all. (Maybe because we are used to London prices). So overall I would really recommend this place out of season.

Unfortunately the overall stay was not pleasant and we won't be returning, especially when there are places that offer a similar experience for a fraction of the price.When we arrived at our woodland lodge we noticed that it wasn't particularly clean, with little bits of food in the fridge, crumbs on the side and spider webs all on the roof. As off-putting as this was, we shrugged it off determined to enjoy our stay, however we paid over ¬£700 for the cheapest accommodation and would of at least expected it to be cleaned. I have seen similar mention of this in other reviews with the response being ' if you had reported it, it would be cleaned etc' however for that eye watering amount of money it should be standard.We also noticed later in the week that our oven was broken and had to have the maintenance team out to fix it.The area the lodge was in (Cedar) was very quiet and serene and we saw different wildlife every day.The activities we took part in were all excellent and we believe them to be well worth the cost.One thing we tried to avoid going to was the centre. Jam packed and an unpleasant visit every time we needed to go. Also there is no designated smoking places so we were constantly trying to avoid smoke clouds, not very good when it boasts of being a great place for kids. We also visited Bella Italia one night and wish we hadn't. Disinterested staff who made it clear they would of rather been anywhere else and it was so loud I couldn't even hear my partner across the table. Maybe great for families but not if you are a couple wanting a relaxing meal out.Communication isn't great and we were never told when to check out or how and had to find the information in a book at the lodge. Also signage of lodges and different areas is not very clear. We found it easier to go on walks and find our own way.On the last day we stripped the bed linen ( as asked in the book) and found our mattress and duvet to be covered in urine and blood stains. We were disgusted that, that is what we had been sleeping on for the week, especially when staying at a 'luxury' resort. Overall the activities were good but everything else was a miss.

It's a drive through check in which you queue in your car for, the actual process itself was very quick but then you queue in more traffic to try and drive to your lodge. When we arrived at the lodge it was disgusting! The maid hadn't bothered hoovering so we had to waste time hunting a maid down to come clean. One of the bed linens had mud stains on but luckily we had booked more rooms than we needed so could swap. We'd booked in to a newly refurbished 3 bed and all I can say is I'd hate to see what the non refurbished ones looked like. There was paint peeling off window frames and the front door, frayed bits of carpet,mould on the bathroom ceiling, limescale on the tiles, even the towels were frayed. We had two toilets and a kitchen so 3 sinks in total yet they'd only provided us with one hand soap? I guess take extra hand soap. There were some useful things in the accommodation like stools for kids in the bathroom but a toilet seat for toddlers would be a good idea. Also a stair gate on the kitchen would have been nice as it's all open plan and you had to have the oven door wide open to use the grill.  I'd read poor reviews regarding kitchen contents so took my own sharp knife which was definitely needed. We went swimming every morning but due to nap times we had to go for 10am every day, the changing rooms were ok, the lockers worked with a wristband that you also had to access your accommodation. Every morning without fail the pool opened 5-10mins late and with a toddler 10 minutes is a lifetime. The pool was great, warm enough and plenty of different areas. We had an incident that required a trip to first aid whilst by the pool, it took far too long to get an ice pack and given that it was an eye injury on a toddler it would have been nice to be directed towards the nurses or even made aware of their presence.  We ate out twice once at Bella italia, food was ok, a decent toddler/kids menu, service was slow &amp; drinks forgotten. The second was at Hucks, we arrived 10 minutes early for our booking and were told that despite a massively empty restaurant we couldn't be seated, when we came back 10 minutes later we had to join a large queue, why? Is the Center Parcs experience queueing? There was no toddler menu just an overpriced kids buffet at ¬£10 each, given how much a 2 year old eats compared to a 12 year old this is ridiculous. The service was appalling and slow but there was kids play area. We ordered burgers, the buns salad and fries were all ok but the burger itself was inedible, it was over cooked and gristly. The outdoor playgrounds were great, the little beach area was nice. We booked two activities whilst there, the first was the Segway experience, the course was ok but it was far too short, it would be far safer to have a longer practice period before going out and then perhaps injuries could have been avoided. The second was an evening kids entertainment, it was listed on the schedule as music/dancing 2-5 years which would have been great for our 2 year old, but it wasn't.  It turned out to be a magic show extremely unsuitable for the age group we had to leave after 15minutes. Worth a mention if you're someone who likes a lay in, it's near an air base and there's a lot of noisy jets flying over head.",1.0,-1,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0

We decided to rent a cabana in the subtropical swimming paradise for the first time - after managing to get one for ¬£30 for 3 hours which didn't seem too unreasonable. I would say the pool is so loud it almost makes having a tv pointless as even with the tv turned up full, you do struggle to hear it. The free drinks and towels were useful but I personally found it awkward to sit in as anybody can look in as they pass and it didn't feel private enough. I do Think it would be a good idea for parents with young children though. Not sure it is worth the usual ¬£50 price tag though! The swimming paradise itself is wonderful though, with my favourite rapids out of all of the centerparcs pools and plenty to do. We also did the family quiz which was an enjoyable few hours. We rented out a pedealo and an electric boat and I have to say we much preferred the peadalo, the electric boats are enjoyable but a bit slower than we expected, so again, perfect for families. The adventure golf is brilliantly themed and we had a great time playing this. We enjoyed meals out at hucks (twice) and the foresters inn for breakfast which was incredible (vegetarians should check out their vegetarian breakfast which was incredible and good value too)! Overall we had a great stay as always but I've stopped short at giving a full five stars as it does seem as though most things are overpriced for what they are and I can see how people would struggle to afford to do a lot of different activities with bigger families.

However, upon arrival we found countless faults with our accommodation. There were numerous maintenance issues, including a broken back door lock, a broken freezer door handle which snapped within about five minutes of us arriving and the TV screen totally froze so that we couldn't even turn it off. We called guest services and they sent out Carla, whose service was excellent - she responded quickly and was super friendly. However, we then discovered that the back door light wasn't working and neither was the oven timer - to name just a few of the further issues we had.I also have various food allergies - including wheat and nuts. Upon arrival, the accommodation looked as though it hadn't been cleaned at all since the last people had been in the lodge - there were crumbs on every surface, in the cupboards, in the fridge, in the microwave and on the floor. I had to thoroughly clean all of these to ensure that my food wouldn't become contaminated, which really annoyed me. We then spoke to guest services again and they sent out another staff member from the maintenance department. He replaced the oven timer but didn't even look at the back door light, despite us reminding him. We were then offered a partial refund by the manager that we accepted, although these issues shouldn't have been issues in the first place and it really put a dampener on our holiday. Another thing that should be noted is that the restaurants - or at least some of them - don't seem to have allergen books. This is massively inconvenient for anyone who has allergies or a family member with allergies. Overall, I have been disappointed with this holiday.

groupe_7,"I'm giving this a 3 star rating as had it not been for the group of friends I was with and the excellent response of the maintenance team this trip would've put me off going back. We stayed in an executive lodge (Ash 47) with hot tub/sauna/games room however for the price you pay it just wasn't good enough. The lodge was clean,no dust or stray hairs however in the toilet by the sauna there was an unpleasant smell which the cleaners tried to deal with but they suspected it was a drainage issue. The oven was not checked and subsequently when we tried to cook dinner we found it not working at all. The maintenance men were fantastic and swapped it out ASAP. We had no running water on arrival so were unable to flush the toilets or make a cup of tea. Again the maintenance team were fast in responding however due to an oversight in dealing with the problem we ended up with no heating and as we already had a log burner that was out of order on a cold wet weekend it just wasn't acceptable.There were other issues too :Broken wardrobe door,safe not working,window not closing properly,kitchen light flashing,bed linen being so crisp it woke you up every time you moved.I cannot fault the maintenance team and the manager who dealt with our complaints but these are issues you shouldn't have to deal with at this price range.

groupe_7,"Our first visit to CenterParcs, Elveden Forest and it certainly won't be our last.  The place had us from the first cheery hello from the staff member in the security cabin. Everything went without a hitch. We stayed in a woodland lodge which was spotless and very roomy. We adored the tropical swimming centre, it was everything we hoped and much more. So spacious, so much to see and do from very warm splash pools for the tiniest child to hair raising tube slides for the more adventurous.  The peace and quiet away from the main centre was absolutely marvellous.  Early one morning we took a bike ride around the park, we felt miles from reality and delighted at every turn. At one point we were struggling to take a family pic of us on our bikes and a lovely staff member stopped his bike, and came over and took it for us. Even though there was obviously hundreds of people there and hundreds of lodges it is all so cleverly organised that we never felt crowded. Every single part of the park is full of exciting things to see and do. Or you can just light the barbecue, sit on your patio, unwind with a glass of wine and enjoy the sights and sounds of nature. The staff were amazing and really were the cherry on top.

groupe_7,"We stayed Monday-Friday in a 2 bed executive lodge. It was very clean as per usual, and nicely presented. We were meant to have some wine and chocolates there for my mums birthday, but they were forgotten. Not a huge deal though. The village square was again immaculately clean, as were the inside areas that we saw. The bar staff were helpful as per usual. The bowling we played was very good- the only thing I would suggest is that we could have specific balls in each lane, as currently you have to try and swap from other lanes to get one you can use. I accept that's difficult to police though. We also did the adventure golf- although it was a good activity, it had far too many people on the course at the same time. This caused delays at each hole- I have suggested to Center Parcs that a member of staff limits the amount of people on the site at one time.We also went in that lovely swimming pool. We went on the adult flume, and a serious incident occurred. My mother went down before me. I then waited until the light went green. This happened fairly quickly I thought, but I put that down to not being used to timings. About 2-3 seconds later I crashed into my mother. Luckily we exited relatively safely, and then proceeded to report the incident. I was shocked to be told they were aware of issues with the flume- I assumed it would have been closed if they were already aware of these issues. We spoke to the pool manager afterwards and were assured the issue had been fixed, with the flume having been shut for about 15 minutes after we left the pool. The following day when I went in the pool, I could see that the flume was closed again, which suggests further issues had arisen. Other than this issue the pool was lovely, and the water was very warm.The shops were nice as usual- the staff in The Store room were especially nice, and made sure my mum got some of the lovely jam they stock. I also managed to buy some more of the stuffed animals for my Center Parcs collection- I'm up to about 11 now! I would however recommend bringing as much with you as possible by way of supplies- the parc market has decent products, but they are expensive. Moving on to food outlets- the pancake house was lovely as usual. The service was good despite it being extremely busy, and the quality of the food was very good. Price wasn't too bad compared to other places within Center Parcs. Next- Bella Italia- they were very good all round. The stuffed crust Pizza is exceptional, the chips tasted lovely and the staff were all very attentive. The food my parents had was also lovely, and we would definitely return here, as we would with Pancake House.Prepare yourselves for this one- Forresters inn. I've already put a review in specifically for them on their Trip Advisor page, so I won't go on too much. Safe to say I believe there are serious food safety issues there (under cooked meat), as well as shockingly poor service from a manageress there and a menu that is getting smaller every time we visit, with prices going up. Please find the review I put on for them specifically (make sure you have time to read and digest it all), but just remember this- AVOID it at all  costs. It's a disgrace Center Parcs are letting it continue to operate in such poor shape. It used to be our favourite place to eat, but we have vowed not to go near it again- certainly until we have received clear evidence that the huge litany of issues have been sorted. You will be able to see from reviews from other people that they are obviously facing severe issues that Center Parcs appear to be ignoring.You might ask why I've given it four out of 5 despite the issues I've mentioned above. It's a fair question, and the answer is this- it's hugely relaxing. We can sit there, feed the ducks, squirrels and pigeons and just forget about everything that is going on. We can walk around the forest in virtual silence and just let time pass us by. There are some lovely individual staff there who should get recognition who make our stays that much better. But for the money we pay to stay there, we think Center Parcs should be taking more notice of these issues. We are in contact with their CEO as well as the CEO of the company that run the Forresters Inn Concession, and we are hoping to help them go through these issues to get it back to five out of five.",1.0,0,1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

We arrived yesterday and as usual we went to the pool about 6.30 for the evening as it doesn't shut until 9pm. This is something we always do as it's quieter in the evening and frees up the day for other activities. To our shock when going on the cyclone we were told you can no longer have one adult on with 2 children and that the ride shuts at 7pm......! I was told that centre Parcs found it wasn't cost effective to have it open between 7 &amp; 9 as they had done a tally &amp; found it wasn't very busy between these times. (Hence the reason we go at that time....!) I am not too keen on the ride so that either forces me to do something I don't want to do or my husband miss out on the ride as the children can ride on their own. So it has to be a minimum of 2 adults. What then happens to single parent families, families with a pregnant mum, a parent with a heart or back problem...?! BE AWARE, children have to ride on their own or have 2 adults. They charge for photos but unfortunately you therefore won't have a family photo if there are only 2 or 3 of you (unless there are 2 adults &amp; 1 child). Closing at 7 is a joke, especially on a Friday when people are arriving. BE AWARE WHEN BOOKING MEALS, don't be like us thinking you have all evening in the pool if you want to go on this ride.

The quality of food and the prices you pay for such drival!!Dexter's kitchen avoid. They were having a deep clean on the night I visited and it was clear the burgers were reheated / recooked so they could close early. Burgers were burnt. I took my sons out of the restaurant with me as I felt rushed to leave. I showed it to others who asked what it was like (15 potential customers) and they immediately turned away as they looked appalled by the quality.If Center Parcs wants to charge rip off prices then you expect gourmet style burgers etc. I know it is a captured market but you don't expect to pay more than London Prices for a sub standard quality.Same goes for Parc Market &amp; Starbucks. Should not be 30% more than Sainsbury's and other Starbucks.Center Parks needs to realise if they were more competitive the stores and restaurants would be busier and they would still earn more income than they do now which means more profit. I saw many people turnaround in Starbucks when they saw the prices. That's a loss of business.  You can't have income unless people buy from youAlso word of mouth goes along way.

Sherwood and Whinfell to go!The first day was busier than I'd ever seen, especially in the pool, but I put this down to it being handover day and although it was off season (we had permission to take the kids out of school after a year from hell but that's another story), the cheaper rates meant that it was busy with families and pre-school children as well as couples. In fact we learned that Elveden is never less than 97% full which was good to know, but despite some reviewers complaining about feeling crowded, after the first day it began to feel more spacious with plenty of room to breathe and enjoy the site. Particularly the Rapids which my 6 year old daughter could now enjoy for the first time. We must have zoomed down them 50-60 times over the weekend!One note to make, the Tropical Cyclone no longer allows one adult and one child so my 9 year old son and I had to partner up with two ladies we didn't know. That makes for quite the ice breaker I must say. On the Saturday we went bowling followed by quite literally a magical carvery at the Pancake House. I have to say that we were fearing the worst but Olly and his magic show turned out to be a highlight of our trip this year. He was great with the kids and utterly baffled us with some great tricks. The couple of hours we were there were a joy and I hope he reads this. Our cleaners were great and provided a top service. If you see yours, do remember to say hello.

Couldn't fault the location- ducks, deer, squirrels and even a peacock came to our door.We had booked a few activities but in hindsight really wish we hadn't.

Maybe our eldest was at the perfect age for the facilities, maybe we were just really in need of a break or maybe it's that this time it was just the 4 of us u2013 no in laws or parents to add into the mix. Whatever the reason, we truly had an amazing time. We chose to try Sherwood Forest after visiting Whinfel in the lakes the year before for the Winter Wonderland (from 1st weekend in Nov). We didn't regret the choice u2013 although they both have an incredibly similar (If not mirrored) set up, our preference was Sherwood Forest. We booked pretty last minute by our standards u2013 only 4 weeks before travelling and in my opinion (and as far as Centre Parcs goes) I think we bagged a steal! We booked online, but the customer service team were always on hand to answer any questions we had over the phone and were incredibly helpful. We were travelling as a family of 4 and booked a 3 bed woodland lodge for 4 nights Mon-Fri. We decided that our eldest and youngest could have their own areas to sleep u2013 in the hope that we might get a bit of peace! Before we arrived I had been using our online account to pre-book some activities for our eldest (3), and also some restaurants. We learnt the hard way last time we visited that the best times to eat and some of the activities sell out long before you arrive. We weren't to be beaten this time! I liked how the online account showed your itinerary in a really well laid out manner and you could access at any time adding on where avails allowed up to the day of travel.On arrival to the village our early check in ensured a swift pass through security to our accommodation. (I have to say though the Whinfel check in was incredibly modern compared to Sherwood.) From the moment you arrive you feel relaxed and the smell of the pine trees and sounds of the forest remind you that you are truly surrounded by nature. We followed the guides around to our little log cabin nestled in a secluded woodland area close to the waters edge. We paid extra to be in the village centre so everything was within a 5 minute walk u2013 it was perfect. We unloaded the car (bit hectic as there were no dedicated bays near our accommodation) and couldn't wait to get rid of the wheels for 4 whole days.We chose not to hire bikes, but Josh took his balance bike, which he rode around the village everywhere and loved it. The hire rates are reasonable and there are also bikes with side cars to pull any little ones along in. We did end up hiring a pram, as after unpacking realised we hadn't brought ours (who does that?!) and again this was a really reasonable rate of ¬£30 for the week and was easy to sort from the hire shop. Our accommodation was listed as one of the older style lodges. We had stayed in executive last time and didn't really see much difference. The living space was light and airy with plenty of room for all and a family bathroom. The bedrooms were small but contained everything you would need and there was plenty of storage for all including boots, wellies, jackets prams and bikes. The additional bathroom we only discovered on the day we were going home and there was a fantastic store room with safe, ironing board, vac etcu2026 We had a resident swan and duck that would come around the same time each day tapping on our window for food which was cute and Josh found it hilarious. I did have a bit of a ghostly experience one night or so I thought u2013 but it could very well have been a gin induced hallucination or sleep deprivation. (Although I did google where we were staying and someone had commented on trip advisor they had a similar experience).The food options were excellent, with something to suit all palates u2013 you couldn't go hungry here. The village square featured a mixture of snack and chain restaurant options, as well as centre parcs own brands and a takeaway too. We decided to take our hello fresh family boxes with us for 2 nights and chose to eat at the American diner 'Hucks' and get takeaway for the remaining 2. Hucks was incredible. We had booked an early bird offer which meant that we ate off a separate menu and had drinks included. Josh helped himself to the kids mini buffet which was Uber cute and we enjoyed the usual suspects on an American menu u2013 everything fried with a side of onion rings. Heaven. The best part of this place was the play area u2013 which we kept under wraps until josh's plate was clean. It was an incredible area and close to all tables ensuring parents could keep a close eye on little ones while they finished meals in peace. Whinfel had a Hucks too but no play area only a computer zone. I couldn't recommend this restaurant more. Apart from dining in, we also enjoyed visits to the pancake house and also the takeaway, which was delivered by bike to our lodge within the hour. They even delivered alcohol. Not too shabby! The Facilities at Sherwood Forest are fantastic for kids with the central focus being on the subtropical swimming paradise in the centre. All areas are signposted and with various maps across the forest it's hard to go wrong. The pathways are flat and easy for even the smallest legs to navigate and there are enough stop offs / viewing points and shops in the centre to keep you going for a while should the weather take a turn for the worse. The bike and pram stores are mainly undercover and are in abundance. The pool area is why most people come here. It is huge and with slides and areas for all ages, including the young at heart you can't go wrong in here. Changing rooms are clean and well organised with plenty of family areas and you can pay extra to dry the family in an oversized drying booth at the end. Always fun. If you are feeling a bit extra you can hire a private cabana for 2 hours u2013 a haven with a mini bar, tv and a base to chill or enjoy lunch in peace. At ¬£75.00 for 6-8 people for 2 hours it's worth it for a special occasion. The pool area has various food and drink outlets allowing a quick pit stop in between splashing and the outdoor hot tub and lazy river were the fave with my family. Oh and the yellow slide which I pretty much stood at the bottom of for around 3 hours. Activities at centre parcs are in abundance and there are simply too many to list. All are featured in age appropriate groups online/in the brochure so you can choose the right activity for your brood. We chose to do the mini jeep safari, and the mini jet skis, as well as within the Activity Den u2013 the chocolate chef experience, pirates and princess party, superhero party (don't forget to take a costume) and bowling. All good value I thought! We enjoyed too the 3 hour slots that the kids activities warrant and even snook off to the on site Aqua Sana spa during 1 session. The spa was quite simply incredible. A 5 min walk or so from the activity den meaning more time for us. We had 2 treatments each as well as access to the spa facilities. It was a welcome break for our weary bodies, and a lovely treat and time away from the kids. We were pretty lucky to only get rain for about half an hour during our stay which meant we could enjoy the great outdoors so much more. We have already booked to go back next year with our friends and their 2 childrenu2026.Our break cost a total of ¬£365.00 for a 3 bed central woodland lodge for 4 nights with early check in. We travelled in May during term time and spent around ¬£500 additional on food, drink and activities and the forgotten pram. Top tips; Book a central pad if there's availability u2013 it's worth the additional price just to keep moaning at bay. Pre book activities for kids as they get booked up u2013 they are well worth it! Be prepared for the rain (we are in the U.K. after all) Pay for early check in to avoid the queues on arrival.

groupe_7,"Having always been put off Center Parcs by the price, believing that Hoseasons Lodges offered better value for money, we decided to take advantage of a 3 night weekend break that seemed reasonably priced (¬£479 for a 2 bed woodland lodge at sherwood) and allow the kids to miss the Monday at school (shock horror!) to make the most of the time there, and we were very pleasantly surprised. Whilst the activities&amp; restaurants really are extortionately priced, we took advantage of the (free) subtropical swimming pool, the woodland paths and cosy nights in the lodge cooking &amp; watching (family-friendly) films. The pool area is phenomenal and you can quite happily spend 4+ hours in there at a time. We booked a cabana for the Sunday evening (¬£50 for 3 hours) and whilst we enjoyed having the private space, it is very much a novelty and a one-off. To make the most of it you need to sit in it and to do that means not being in the pool or on the slides. It would be much better if it could be booked by the day to take full advantage. Whilst bikes can be hired on-site, we  brought the kids bikes with us from home to keep cost down and made use of the woodland paths, cycling to the nature reserve and the beach. The lodge was a standard 2-bed lodge (not an upgraded one) and it was lovely. Perfect size &amp; location with everything needed for a weekend (or indeed a week long) stay. The best bit about the whole trip was feeding the ducks &amp; squirrels outside our patio each morning &amp; evening with the nuts &amp; seeds bought from the onsite supermarket (¬£5 for 2 v.large bags)We will definitely be returning (although not in the school holidays when the prices double, if not treble!)",0.0,,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

When we arrived we were directed where to park, even though we couldn't check into our lodge yet we were still allowed to park in front of it. Then we headed to the Aqua Sana and were checked in so fast. The ladies at the front desk were incredibly friendly and helpful. Once checked in and changed, we were asked to report to the Sana cafe where we were greeted, given a drink and pastry and our Center Parcs vouchers for our stay. Then we had the run of the spa facilities all day. The rooms were incredible, so much choice and all so clean and welcoming. Our personal favourite was the Forest View room! We were served lunch in the Sana Cafe which was delicious, light and a lot of choice. Then headed back to the spa for more relaxation. The staff were so friendly and informative. Our lodge was an executive lodge which was small but perfect and clean. We had prebooked our evening meal at the Country Club which was a 30 minute walk, which we enjoyed. The only downfall of the whole stay was the poor service in the Country Club. They got my order incorrect and we waited a long time to be seated, get drinks, have our order taken and to pay the bill. However, still a lovely walk to and from the lodge. The next day we had breakfast in the spa cafe which was delicious and fresh and then were told we had use of all the village facilities. So went for a swim in the SubTropical Paradise which was incredible! Lunch was in the Sports cafe and we can't praise it enough. Fast service, polite staff, delicious food and great atmosphere!!

The signage around the camp to get to your accomodation is dreadful.  Told on arrival to look for yellow signs (there were none). As the map is colour coded you think there would be a big colour sign for each section of the accomodation. So I think you need some special powers to find your chalet.

Our third Centre Parc break in 12 months and our last!We booked an executive lodge which was in dire need of a good clean and refurb to say the least. With lots of minor repairs needed which obviously you couldn't be bothered to carry out. One double bedroom stank so badly of mould we couldn't sleep in it and myself and my husband ended up sharing the twin room with our toddler!We couldn't use the outside area, sauna or leave our patio door or windows open due to a rat infestation...it's lovely to dine on the patio of an evening with rats running over your feet!On arrival I reported a pile of human faeces and used wet wipes on a pathway around the lake, it was still there two days later when I reported it again. I don't expect to have to dodge piles of human s**t when taking a stroll!The subtropical area was filthy and trying to get a changing cubicle is a total joke.I complained to guest services on the Parc and was offered a refund of the amount we paid to select our lodge...in vouchers to use in the Parc,  money I'd paid to select a lodge that was far far from executive, so basically the refund offered me nothing!Despite reporting all of this on your emails requesting feedback and by direct email to customer service I haven't had any response!

groupe_8,"This is our 4th or 5th visit to this center parc. We have visited the woburn one more lately as sherwood was looking shabby. Woburn is great -new, clean, quiter - but hilly, and not as good for cycling practice. We stayed in an executive 2 bed lodge that was well specced with tassimo coffee maker, wine cooler and 3 tvs. It was well maintained and clean so no complaints there. The reason for the title of my review is that as soon as we arrive, we unwind. The kids run around trying things they haven't done before. The adults behave like kids. I love woods and this has some great areas and wildlife. By the end  of the first day we had seen squirrels (lots) ducks, geese, rabbits, swan and any number of birds and butterflies. The are very tame - they will pretty much knock on your patio door to get you to feed them. What's most stand out though is the customer service. Every single person we have met has been incredibly kind, nice and sincere. From notes left by the lady who cleaned the lodge, people in shops, at the cycle centre - everyone was lovely. Its lost 1 star because it is a bit too busy in the pool areas (but its half term, and some of the pool areas are being refurbed) and it is pretty expensive.

groupe_8,"This was our first time in Centre Parcs as well as in Elveden.  Having read some mixed reviews I had some concerns that were either unfounded or were professionally addressed by CP.   There are however some reasons why I only gave four stars that I will address later. Concern 1: CP are still building more villas and this is causing traffic and noise.  Some pretty large building works are ongoing but I did not find this was causing either noise or traffic.  We were however given villa 853 (brand new) that was close to the works and had hardly any vegetation around it.  We explained we wanted a nature/forestexperience and CP gave us the opportunity to change which we did. We ended in villa 935, an older construction but perfectly functional where we were surrounded by greenery and wildlife, including small deer that were coming close to the house in the morning.  Well done to CP for helping us change villa on arrival. Concern 2: I had read that staff were not always enthusiastic about serving customers.   I must say that I have been struck by the opposite and that there are numerous daily examples of the contrary and of everyone going beyond the call of duty to help satisfy us. Some very effective talent selection and training was showing through. Concern 3: I saw some comments about the tropical pool being overcrowded.  I was there during the Easter break and, yes, things were busy, but it never reached unacceptable limits. The pool is really big and the Cyclone is a lot of fun. So, why not 5 stars? ...food... I was not going there for a gastronomic experience but I must say that food quality across the resort restaurants offers a lot of room for improvement... simply not very good, though served with a smile!Would I recommend?

groupe_8,"Short break at Elveden with three very excited children who truly loved their stay. However, children aren't concerned about issues adults see - particularly when paying just under ¬£900 for a 3 night stay. We've been visiting here for over a decade and really felt that on this occasion the previously high standards hadn't just fallen; but plummeted. The communal areas were extremely busy and it's the first time we've felt that there aren't enough restaurants as we couldn't get seated on several occasions. Obviously we could have pre-booked but along with all the activities it then feels that the whole break is structured. Then the swimming pools; whilst the children (aged btwn 6 &amp; 13) loved their time swimming I was disappointed to see how busy the pool was. It certainly appeared to be overcrowded and this was confirmed by the wait to use changing cubicles. The changing room floor and cubicles were disgustingly dirty; nappies left thrown on the floor, hair everywhere and just dirty and grotty cubicles which meant getting changed with a 6 year old very difficult overall and very unpleasant. It's true to say that a lot of these issues are down to guests not cleaning up after themselves but that said the areas should be kept clean - and this isn't happening. It's not as though CP aren't aware of the number of guests staying so need to up the ratio of cleaning staff to keep the standards acceptable.I have always been 'happy' to pay to stay at CP but I am now of the opinion that we are unlikely to re-book. However much the children have loved it, there are plenty of other places that would keep adults happy too. There was clearly building work going on around the site but this didn't cause any disruption - but the concern is that you can't keep adding more guest accommodation without adding to the facilities. We did not raise any concerns with staff during our time there as the aspects we took issue with go beyond the staff present and is the way CP is being brought forward. That's fine if you're willing to accept that, but it's no longer for us. Our youngest cried when we left as was sad to leave CP behind, and I am too but for different reasons. We have some lovely memories as a family at CP but the standards around the park have dropped and it is simply overcrowded. ",1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0

I liked that wrist bands were given instead of keys, it just made everything so easy. The park was not fully booked so nothing was too crowded, I imagine when fully booked it could appear crowded based on witnessing change over days.

I asked for the cleaner to be contacted to ensure they checked and was told this would not be nescesarry! 24 hours later I had to ring again to be told the clothing was not found and that there was a chance the cleaners missed the wardrobes as this does happen sometimes??? I asked why I was misinformed the day before and the fact I offered to drive straight back to be able to check myself and was told I would not be allowed to access the park again or the villa but was assured not to worry! The new people were allowed to enter the villa with out the wardrobe being checked either because the cleaners should check themWhen cleaning or because I specifically asked for it to be checked as I know exactly where I left the clothing!

groupe_8,"This is the 4th year running we've been to Center Parcs, and every year we love it. We love being out in the forest with no cars and lots of places to explore. We love the activities that are available, the restaurants are good and the subtropical paradise is definitely the centre piece. That being said, Center Parcs is well known for its extortionate prices. Over the years we have definitely noticed the deterioration of the woodland lodges, which are in desperate need of refurbishment. Unfortunately, it seems the necessary upgrades are being used as a reason to further inflate prices since the 'new' woodland lodges cost 10% more than the unrefurbished ones which have not decreased in price. This is fairly upsetting to see. Despite the high prices, there were cobwebs in every room and no shower curtain. To their credit, when we rang and asked for a shower curtain, they brought one within an hour. However, I also asked for a stair gate to stop my toddler walking straight out of his bedroom and into the kitchen in the night and none was provided, I presume they forgot. In terms of dining, the restaurants provide good food, albeit at high prices. In general they cater well for those with allergies. That said, my son did react to something (milk or soya) from Dexter's on our final evening, which isn't surprising as the server didn't seem to understand what allergens were. Overall I'd recommend Center Parcs for a convenient short break, but there are definitely areas for improvement. Will we return next year? Doubtful.

We stayed in Cedar which was a decent trek from the main area but we liked being a little bit out because it meant our bike journey each time took us through the Parc. The staff were all so friendly and made us feel special. Thank you to you all. The booking process and organisation for checking in and out is excellent. We actually paid a little extra to check into our lodge an hour early, which meant our car was unpacked and back in the car park before 3 o clock and so we missed all the mayhem. I would definitely recommend doing that. Helps get your holiday off to a good start. I feel like this really is a well oiled machine and a great holiday choice in the UK for the family. Granted the trip is not cheap by any means and the activities come at a premium. For example my 2 year old for 14 minutes sat on a horse was ¬£18.50. Really this should be more like ¬£10. If the activities were a little more affordable the kids could have done a lot more which would make you leave feeling as though you really packed a lot in.

We used to visit every year but they got bored and so they grew up and did other things.We actually started with CP about 20 years ago and would estimate that we have visited over a dozen times but what with the 10 year break expected to see many changes. Not really so , the main differences are more lodges and different names on the restaurants plus the driving range is no more (space for even more lodges ?)The pool area is being renovated , not before its time as very little has changed or improved apart from one new ride - cascades.  There are improvements to the exteriors of the lodges making them more attractive , however there are a lot more lodges .We stayed in a basic 4 bed . It was quite tatty albeit it had a new kitchen. The doors are dirty white with filler everywhere and look like the originals botched up. The windows as well look like they were painted by a crew of under 5's .....that isn't renovation that's just scrimping . It wasn't particularly clean and no loo rolls or bin bags provided as they are supposed to be. Also they give you a book with the inventory but obviously don't check it themselves . A lodge for 8 had 5 spoons 7 plates and 7 bowls not the 8 as per the book. We even had a pillow but no pillow case .The light over the table didn't work and had to be replaced. The showers struggled to supply more than a dribble at times.Space is a bit of a joke - the shower room is only as wide as the shower tray and the loo gives you just enough space for a tallish bloke to sit down . It is meant to be for 8 adults but it struggles.Other than the pool everything is geared up to be paid for . It isn't cheap and with so many more lodges it is quite difficult to book whilst you are there. Pre booking is essential but then who knows what the weather will do ?All in all it was an expensive weekend for what it was. Almost ¬£1500 for 8 plus food drink and activities made it around ¬£2000.That I'm afraid doesn't compute to value for money especially when part of the free activity was closed for renovations. The extra lodges though will help then kept the money machine rolling but I fear at the expense of those who continue to be spellbound by its so called magic.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0
groupe_8,"Got an opportunity to go for the first time as there was an offer on.  I must admit that prices had been prohibitive previously but the offer was very good.  Went with my two grown-up daughters and my 3 year-old granddaughter.  We hired two bikes and a toddler trailer.  Neither my daughter nor myself had ridden a bike for many years so we were a little apprehensive but biking in the evening when the park was very quiet was wonderful.  One of my daughters has described the park as a world within a world...it is so peaceful and safe not having cars around and being able to walk or cycle without having to look out for danger and the forest is beautiful including the squirrels, the ducks and their chicks,etc. who are not scared to come very close to the people and the accommodations. The pool despite being partly renovated at the moment was very pleasant, I am not a fan of this kind of water park but we were all glad to see that there is a deeper end where you can actually swim lengths.  We did book extra activities and enjoyed them all.  The toddlers' activities can be a hit or miss, the roller skate one was to difficult for a 3 year old but the slightly older ones seem to enjoy it.  The shops in the park boast the fact that their price is comparable to shops outside.  The supermarket has been described in reviews as very expensive, it is not depending on what you're after.  I would not do my entire shopping there but it is very reasonable for necessities.  In conclusion, we were sad to leave as we enjoyed our stay so much and I would definitely consider it again...when there is a good offer on!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

Whilst they do warn of occasional noise at elveden and longleat we have never heard it ever at longleat, elveden on the other hand is from 8am till 8pm and very loud... if kids are having afternoon naps it would be very difficult. It didn't ruin the holiday but it did taint it and we won't be going back to this particular CP purely because of it. Restaurants were great as always if not extortionately over priced. But they are full and people pay so nothing will change for that... Accommodation very nice and peaceful with the exception of the burglary next door of their bicycle. Which from talking to other guests is a frequent occurrence. So if you have a valuable bike put it inside or buy your own very very good locks. The ones CP sell the thieves can cut through!

This wasn't mentioned to us either prior or upon arrival! My big and only complaint is that we brought our dog with us ... at a price ... yet nowhere on site is dog friendly. It's not pleasant sitting outside the restaurants in March when it's cold and wet. We spoke to customer services manager who apologised but couldn't do anything for us.

We looked out onto woodland and were not directly overlooked by any other lodges.The local wildlife was clearly used to people as they started to appear from the woods almost as soon as we sat outside. We saw Squirrels, Geese, Blackbirds, Crows, Jays, Robins, Coal tits, Great tits, Blue tits, Wrens, Moorhens, Chaffinches, Rabbits, Stoats, Wood pigeons, Tree Creeper, Ducks, Stock doves and even a Hedgehog. It was like our own version of Springwatch.The parc was very easy to navigate and we had lots of lovely walks in the glorious weather.All of the staff we met were incredibly helpful and polite, they all appeared to enjoy their jobs and it showed in the excellent service we received.We will most certainly be going back again, soon I hope.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

Elveden forest 's swimming pool area was better however jacuzzis not as good as Longleat. Elveden is on a flat ground therefore walking is easier but they looked smaller than Longleat. If cycling ud83dudeb4u200du2640ufe0f one's experience is enhanced but if you enjoy walking then it's still ok. Childre's activities pricey however my 3yr old loved the mad haters party so I guess it was worth it.DownsideI was disappointed that we paid extra to live in the middle area only to find out that there were works being carried out a few doors away from us. We were not informed of this and when our neighbor complained they received vouchers worth ¬£220. When we complained later the same day we received voichers worth ¬£170 yet we had a bigger accommodation than our neighbors. Given the choice prior to visiting we would have opted for booking a different area or forest.

groupe_8,"Having never been to Center Parcs before I did quite a bit of research before we arrived. Trawling through past reviews I soon realised that if you're on a budget, preparation is key. So between our family of five. We prepared! We made sure we had cleaning stuff, from washing up liquid, dishwasher tablets, Anti-bac wipes, cloths, tea towel, toilet rolls and kitchen rolls, to condiments: salt and pepper, ketchup, vinegar, mayo and butter! We also had all bases covered for breakfasts from fruit, to yogurts to cooked breakfasts goodies including milk, tea and coffee.  Having everything we needed for food, snacks and cleaning products meant fi we did need to use the onsite supermarket it was only to replenish then we were spending too much. The on-site supermarket has everything you'll need but expect to pay a premium, but if you're prepared then don't! As for the rest of our stay our accommodation was fab! We had regular daily visits from the resident squirrels, ducks, geese and we were able to feed them with bags of pre-bought seeds from home bargains! Again three times the price in the onsite supermarket! Another example of  all being prepared!The swimming pool was super and we hired bikes for the week we were there which was enough for what we wanted from the trip. The only recommendation we have relates to the time of the cycle centre opening and closing, it would help if we were able to drop off the bikes the night before departure at a later time, or earlier than 8am in the morning. We ate at Hucks on one of our evenings. We had anticipated it being incredibly expensive from the reviews we had read. We were pleasantly surprised. Yes it was at the higher end of a pub restaurant, and the food was average, but there was something on the menu for everyone in our party, from 76years old to 2! As we ate in our villa every other night we were able to justify the spend. We also had brunch at the pancake house on our final day. Good pancakes and an enjoyable visit, oh with excellent levazza coffee! All in all a wonderful time was had! The villa was clean and comfortable and the local wildlife made for a great distraction from the tv! Another plus of the property we had was the wine cooler!! Thanks Sherwood!

The very creaky stairs need sorting (no 881) - they kept waking the babies. Pool was nice, and the chutes etc for older children / adults, but it definitely needs the development which is underway now (very unobtrusively), because the areas for babies / young children are quite dated and uninteresting. The changing rooms were a bit manic most times - had to hunt for empty cubicles.Several of our group had spa sessions and loved them. The 4yr old had a pony ride, which was short but she had a great time and the ponies seemed really well looked after. We also used a pedalo and kayak. All these were easy to book via the app before arrival or during our stay.Having two babies, we were struck by the lack of grassy or soft surface areas where we could put the babies down to crawl around outside for a while - the playgrounds were covered with bark chippings, and the small sandy 'beach' had no shade from the sun.Also, I have no idea at all why anyone would think it necessary to play music through speakers at the beach area!?!?I can recommend the pancake with lemon &amp; sugar at the Pancake House!, and the staff there were very nice.Changeover days were very well organised.

However, the Xbox didn't have controllers which you had to pay a ¬£100 deposit to have the controls and 3 games, this wasn't mentioned at the time of booking.

As a family we stayed in a basic lodge, this was clean and had everything you needed. Watching the different wildlife at your patio doors is wonderful.  There are different types of lodges but it's about how much your willing to pay. We did walk to the treehouses, they look amazing. We did call into the sports bar for an evening however the drinks are expensive. We still enjoyed ourselves, there is plenty of space to sit.

For me the Parc layout is really good with the central area being just far enough from the country club to have a nice cycle between. The pool is the biggest draw and the cyclone ride will not fail to deliver its thrills. Arriving for 5 days at the end of March gave us 2.5 days of very wet weather however the children were able to paint pottery, use the sports centre, bowl and play in various internal areas. When the sun arrived the junior quad bikes and tree top trek were both enjoyed. My only niggles were the quality of the villa and prices of the activities, food and drinks. We stayed in 130 Cedar and it needed some maintenance work. Mould around the bath, shower and sinks sealant, all the door handles were loose and 2 of the cooker hobs didn't work. A round of drinks, 4 adult drinks and 4 children's diet cokes cost in excess of ¬£30, that felt steep to me. You are a captive audience therefore I accept the costs being higher but there is absolutely no excuse for the poor maintenance of the villa. One other thing is that they a building a small apartment block and chalets near the central area, the safety of no vehicles driving on site was ruined as heavy deliver vehicles and contractors cars/vans were moving around the front of our villa all through the day. This caused and unwanted risk to our children whilst they were cycling. No discount was ever offered or the works mentioned on the website. We could have chosen a different villa location away from the works had we been informed at the point of booking.

Key problems:- Housekeeping hadn't cleaned our kitchen worktops but it was quickly sorted out by a passing cleaner (thanks!). Then we walked into the bathrooms to find dirty floors, a bottle of radox shower gel from the previous occupants and used towels on the radiator. Just sloppy and no apology when reported.- They are building new accomodation at a fast rate but are not increasing any free activities. The pool is packed, the changing rooms miserable with queues for showers and the rapids are dangerous at busy times. The cyclone wasn't open when we were there.- Paid activities are expensive and my daughter got turned away from one pre-booked activity as she had tiny earrings that couldn't be removed. But they were happy to tape up wedding rings! Cue one hugely disappointed child and a waste of money..- The Woodland Lodges are the old basic accomodation slightly updated and with a modern TV.

Gaps around tiling, bits amongst the paint (when you use a dirty brush) and generally just not right (kitchen doors wouldn't close properly). The cleanliness of the lodge was very poor. The cooker looked disgusting. Absolutely vile. It hadn't been cleaned in a long time. The plates had a layer of scum over so we had to clean again before use.  The floors were generally quite grubby and the bathroom had hairs in. The sky lights were filthy. Absolute disgusting. The TV doesn't even have Freeview.

Two bin bags, and two toilet rolls are provided. You pay for everything else.

The prices in the shop are very high, the prices to eat or drink out are also very high. Bike Hire is ¬£30 for 3 days. The car park as a joke. No spaces at all to park your car. The pool is the only thing free but the changing areas are dirty and cramped and very old. The pool area itself needs a refurb.

Yes gourmet chefs might be irritated by the sharpness of the knives, but we always pack a decent one plus the standard kitchen products (detergent, dishwasher tablets, salt/pepper). Shopping on site gets expensive quickly so we pack enough food for 2 meals, breakfast and snacks plus nice drinks. I'd think if you planned to eat out all the time it would get v pricey!

Cafe rouge disappointingly only had a set Sunday lunch (¬£22 per person) so we skipped that for lunch in the villa. The other facilities/activities on site do begin to add up reasonably quickly but there are peak time prices - so if you are an early riser you can take advantage of offers/deals. If bowling is quiet you can often stay on for an extra hour, same with badminton. I think they are pricing activities out of a standard budget because the cross bow session had only our group booked in all day. Free activities are limited to nature trails and swimming - which is pretty packed! They are building more villas with less facilities.. so yes if you visited years ago then it is disappointing.

groupe_8,"Nothing beats a short break at centre parcs. First time staying in the apartments. Plenty of room. Located overlooking the golf course and has its own car park. In the spring and summer I would be concerned about the noise as road appears close by. However there will be apartments overlooking the lake opening in the summer which may be better located.When closing your apartment door please be careful as on one occasion we returned back to find the door open. May have been housekeeping. If you need a iron or ironing board you need to ask. It would be easier if these items were already stored in the apartment.No issues with housekeeping. Good supply of toliet paper, dishwasher tablets replaced once used. Combined cooker, microwave and grill is slow. Also pans are not the best. However kitchen has all the basics. We opted to shop before we arrived and then purchased a few items on arrival. Bedroom is fine but would be nice to have a sofa. Also table in small. We opted to eat in twice and then go to hicks, pancake house and sports cafe. Although very busy and full capacity it was peaceful, relaxing and pure bliss being here.We enjoyed walking, riding bikes (expensive to hire), we had lots of fun at the spa, playing advenure golf and segway. Centre parcs is perfect for young and old. It's just a shame that there are no barbeque area near the apartments. I liked going to see the greenhouses. Looked amazing. I can see there are villas being refurbished and as always liked seeing local wildlife such as small deer, rabbits, squirrels, frogs, ducks and other birds. I can't wait to have opportunities to return as there is so many things to do which enables you to keep returning. Also staff are around but you feel like you are in your own bubble throughout.

The lift taking you to the bowling alley  was out of order. We had a wheelchair user in our party. We had it confirmed it's been out of action for some time. Duty manager did not know when it was due to be fixed. With many other families with young children with buggies this was a really big minus to the holiday. Thankfully not raining the week we went but if you wanted to access the bowling alley and junior disco (!) then a long, winding,  fairly steep ramp was the only option. (Not sure the degree of slope was suitable as a disabled access?). I was just miffed that there seemed no level of importance allocated to the lift service as 'no one had complained in months about it, except me!'  Ho Hum. They've spent most likely a million or two upgrading the Elveden site on things that will get a return on their money, but not on facilities for those needing easy access.

groupe_8,"It was our first ever visit. We travelled as mum, dad, toddler and nanna. When we first arrived to our villa I was gutted, it was so filthy I could not relax, muddy bathroom floor, thick visible dust everywhere, cobwebs on the ceilings, the floors had not been hoovered and had not seen a mop for years it was disgusting. The tables and chairs had old food on. The shower screen was broken and in the, cabinets, plates had been put back dirty with old food on. I quickly noted that there is no reception for mobile phones and no internal phones. So you cannot call for help if there were an emergency, you cannot call for dine in (if you wanted it) and on this occasion I couldn't call housekeeping. We cleaned enough to get rest for the evening and the next morning spoke to housekeeping. Then the villa was given a good deep clean and the shower was fixed which was much better. But not the best first impression to give anyone. We ate out only twice with mixed experiences. The first restaurant was Bella Italia and the first time we had been out as a couple for a while. Unfortunately I ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail and was given the one with alcohol in (didn't notice until halfway through all the drink had sunk to the bottom) would have been ok but I'm heavily pregnant so not great. The waitress was brilliant but very very VERY friendly so instead of enjoying our quiet couple meal we were forced into conversation for most of it. My husband's burger was not cooked in the middle (I mean stone cold when I say not cooked) but the manager kindly discounted it and it was not too bad. The second night was HUCK's this was much better but my steak even though I asked for well done when I got to the middle it was blood, a shame because pregnant woman have to have steak well done. This was not discounted just a verbal apology and the entire meal was nearly ¬£100 for three adults and a toddler. So both meals were disappointing and adding the villa to this I left slightly underwhelmed with the whole Center Parcs Experience. On the up side, we hired bikes for the weekend which we all enjoyed. I did not see another way to get around easily.  My toddler did the balance bike activity and since he spent the entire weekend on his own bike by the end of the weekend he was competent. We also went swimming - amazing pool area!  Did an electric boat ride and generally enjoyed the grounds. I found staff we came across whilst out and about eager to help and be friendly. So these things saved the weekend.Advice u2013 take pool towels or you have to hire them. Take your own breakfast stuff, we did and it made mornings a lot easier. We took wild bird food and got lots of visitors on our patio area.

It was so quite and peaceful but a 2-5min bike ride to the village, spa and Cycle shop and outdoor activities. Activities consisted of the quad bikes and zip line adventure over the lake. The quads were ace. Just the 4 of us so felt really private. I was a little scared at first but it was so much fun. Felt like we was on them for ages. The Ariel adventure with the zip wire over the lake was tiring and scary but well worth it for the finale at the end. Because we had such good weather we hired an electric boat (legs sore from cyling) lovely to sit and relax.The subtropical swimming area was just how I remembered it from when I was little. It's a little dated but again very fun. The slide with the rubber ring was the best. The rapids where terrifying but hilarious. We chose to go to the Aqua Sana Spa on our last night which was a great decision. It's gorgeous. We went to the late slot 6pm-9pm so it was quieter. I can't comment on any of the restaurants as we did a big food shop so we ate in. But we did eat at the pancake house which was delicious. Average pancake about ¬£8.There is a fairly large supermarket. Prices are as high as I'd say Sainsburys or Coop but handy if you want to grab something. The lodge was an excellent size with 2 bathrooms. It was nice and clean. I would have preferred an extra towel for drying hands and standing on.

It was busier this time of year with young children than in the summer months.It is only a matter of time until there is a serious accident with the largely inflated numbers of cars, vans and lorries on site. The worst ones are the CP green vans, some driving far to fast on what we expect to be a safe site. A lot of the vans have only person in , many are electric vans meaning you can't hear them as they approach from behind as you are walking. They do not appear to follow any flow of traffic and seem to drive in all directions, yet the cars we drive are expected to follow the one way system. The number of workmen vans is ridiculous. The workmen seem to flout many rules, we saw workmen, throwing cigarettes butts on the floor, and their rubbish was also thrown. The cost of food and supplies in the onsite mini market have shot up, even since last September When we last visited. The lodge we stayed in maple was fine, nothing special, relatively clean that still doesn't stop me from putting all crockery and cutlery in the dishwasher when we first arrive.I think it's an insult to charge so much for a lodge and then to be given only two toilet rolls for two bathrooms. One of the bathrooms didn't even have a loo roll on the holder. There was no baking tray in the oven, a sharp knife with a broken handle was really quite dangerous to use.

The parking was a nightmare and we struggled to drive down to our lodge as cars were dumped everywhere. When we got there the cleaner was still in the room but we allowed her to finish and then we started to unload our car. After we had unpacked the familys things we wanted a little sit down. To my disappointment I found the lodge to be filthy and if I hadn't seen the cleaner leave myself I would have said that it hadn't been cleaned at all. There was dried spilled coffee on the bedside table, skid marks in the toilet, Hairs down the side of the toilet anf the whole place smelled of bacon sandwiches. By this time the kids were very hungry and we needed to get them fed so I sorted them and my wife decided she would clean the bathroom herself and then report it as we didn't want to move as we had unpacked everything. Thankfully after this my stay improved and the following day after all the cars had gone to the car park I found the parc to be lovely. The food outlets weren't that badly priced either only slightly higher priced than outside the parc. I am however a little disappointed that pretty much everything at the park costs extra unlike Haven and Butlins which include quite a few activities in the price. In all the parc was loved but the lodge was the biggest let down as it was dirty. The sofa was also very dirty and old.

Although we didnt pay for early atrival we were warmly welcomed and free to use facilities.Parking space was available eventhough it seemed packed.We ate at Bella Italia. As we are with young children it was suggested we sit near soft play and window over looking the tropical pool area.So we agreed. Food was very nice, lasagna and two pizzas.There was more than enough to go round two hungry adults and two toddlers.So we get to our lodge (pine area), i decided not to pay an extra fee to select so pine we were served.We get in with ease, to find a warm welcoming message on the board. Nice touch.Two rooms spacious and comfortable to stay in.We removed the single bed base and allowed the children sleep on the matress which was on the floor.For safety; the above was done as well as lock the ensuit bathroom door from the outside, as to not have a flood in the lodge caused by the children.As weather was warm heating wasnt used much. But when it was heat escaped through windows due to positioning of the radiators under windows, which is covered by long thick-ish curtains and there was no window sil.As a suggestion to make the lodge more energy effiecient change to arrangement can be made.So the only beneficial heat came from bathroom radiators.A benefit to add, is that when travelling with toddlers washing of clothes may be necessary, so after hand washing soiled garments bathroom radiators were very useful.We needed the vacation but cud not leave the country, hence our stay here. So my first choice was all inc spain. But its refreshing to experience such beauty just 2hrs away from home.As for activities, we didnt pre-book as we didnt wish to b tied down by time. Life is busy enough with time lines and deadlines so we opted to chillout!Plus there was not a great deal the toddlers could do together. They are a year apart so would be separated and that wud mean the familiy separated at diff activities.Other than lounging, we made good use of the free activities all the family could enjoy together. Not to mention the twin push cars we hired to make transporting of the children that much easier. Plus they enjoy the drive.Do note the push cars can not be booked in advance of your holiday booking.On to the food!Im a pregnant lady so i like generous portions, which bella got spot on. However forsters could do with a little advice. On the breakfast voucher only the trad breakfast or vegan breakfast is avail. And boy did they go sparce on the portions.Just as well im the type of mom to pack the whole bathroom and kitchen so we had two breakfasts.To b honest its best with toddlers to eat the food they r used to.So to conclude centre parcs sherwood forest has a lot to offer for free if u look. Dont rush into booking one activity after the next. Take a min or two to walk around all 400 acers and really take in the grounds. Bring ur own bikes, trikes, trailers if u have em and save ¬£30 (price for adult bike) and if your not found of walking pay that extra to select your lodge.As by day 3 i grew weary of the walk from lodge to village sq.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0

We hired bikes and spent most of our time cycling around the village stopping at the various play parks and animals that the little one wanted to look at more.We had a couple of meals on site pancake house and the cafe in the pool area both fine. We enjoyed bbqs at the lodge on evenings just so more of a wind down for the toddler, and did a bit of shopping before we entered the Parc (Tesco about 10 mins away) did buy a few bits on site and only a bit more expensive.Did a couple of paid activities mini captains adventures which was great and the staff at the activity and boathouse were lovely with the kids... and crazy golf (never ever do crazy golf with a toddler what were we thinking)We had no issues with getting in to the village but we did arrive at 4pm so maybe missed the hustle, straight to lodge and unloaded then car drop off with a little drive around for a space but found one within 10mins. Again same for day of leaving.We had very little road traffic during the week maybe we hit a quiet week but could easily get about on bikes and not worry about traffic as some people's review have indicated.

Three bedrooms all ensuite,roomy fully equipped kitchen and comfortable sitting area ensured the best of comfort. Each room had its own television with a wide range of channels. The cot provided for our granddaughter was a real cot and very easy to collapse and erect. Very well thought through.The kitchen had every utensil needed for self catering and the barbecue set up on the terrace was ideal during the good weather. Having our own sauna attached was also a great bonus.All in all the accommodation could only be described as ideal and of the highest quality.Having ducks,swans and squirrels come right up to the patio window provided endless hours of entertainment for our baby granddaughter.There was so much to do in the Park. Cycling,walking,boating on the lake,high wire walk and use of the magnificent swimming pool kept us entertained every day.

groupe_8,"Fantastic Break!Back from a four night stay at Elveden. Checked in and had a short wait to get through the check in kiosk then made our way to our lodge (326) in Pine. Lodge was easy enough to find and recently refurbished with all amenities needed and had been cleaned for us. Managed to get a spot outside our lodge to offload and then load later in the week but it was very busy and spaces were quickly taken up. Would recommend getting there early to get a spot otherwise may become difficult.With basic tv features available I brought my Firestick and was able to connect to Netflix and BBC iPlayer and the wifi signal was great. During the week plenty of wildlife came to visit us including squirrels, ducks and a few deer! The lodge is very close to the Pond so can always walk down and see many more which was nice. BBQ available on the back patio too but decided not to use it.  Was originally concerned the lodge would be a long walk to the centre but it was only 10-12 mins away. Did have a torch with me but pathways are dimly lit and you can find your way. Based on the distance decided against renting any cycles but they did look like lots of fun. It was lovely walking around with no cars driving past. You do see the odd maintenance vehicle but it was not that frequent.Activities we booked: Swim pups - short swimming class and done in around 20mins but my 11 month old had funBaby casting u2013 took only 10mins and collected on the last day, happy with the final product!Photo shoot u2013 30min photo shoot and we now have to choose a picture, photographer was very friendly and enjoyed the sessionPottery Painting u2013 40min session and you get to choose an item from a small range, was good fun and collected on our last dayWe had booked sensory but did not make it, the centre kindly refunded us back the money which was nice and we went swimming instead. The swimming facilities are great, something there for all ages and the kids area was fun! Would recommend making the most of it as no cost to keep going back. The buggy park gets full quickly and you may want to take a lock to secure it and get peace of mind but many just left theirs unlocked. Lockers activated through your wristbands which was handy as well as the family changing rooms. We ate out at Hucks and the Pancake House where we had the carvery. Both times the service was fantastic and the magician/entertainer at the Pancake House was good fun! All the kids seem to be having a good time as well. We also visited the Sports Bar which had nice food with lots of screens to watch all kinds of Sports and a small softplay area for kids. Outside the Sports centre there are swings and another play area for the kids as well as all the other outdoor activities which come at a cost to use as well as some of the indoor ones.The Parcmarket has everything you need if you need any grocery items. Yes the prices are a little extra but not hugely expensive but handy knowing everything is there. We did purchase the fire logs there as smoke free but I think you could buy a little cheaper.The checkout time does seem a bit early at 10am and you see people getting their cars early to get a spot so I would recommend doing the same to make sure you can load your bags easily.Overall great break and we would definitely return or maybe try another location!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

groupe_8,"We have just returned from a Monday - Friday stay in a 4 bed executive lodge with 6 adults and 2 toddlers. The accommodation was good and we had deer, ducks and squirrels at the patio doors daily. Although in places the lodge was a little tired, the pool table had a big stain on it, one of the ensuite doors didn't close as the door had swollen and the travel cot was broken and 1 side didn't click into place. There were wooden cots available too but our son preferred the travel cot. The oven temperature dial had been snapped off so there was no way to know the temperature of the oven, we contacted guest services and they had it replaced within an hour which was great service. There were only 4 bike stands outside which seemed a bit odd as the villa sleeps 8 so we ended up chaining the bikes together.The lodge was located around a 15/20 minute walk from the centre (toddlers pace) which would have been fine had we not had to keep stopping and standing in the mud to let staff vans/cars and lorries pass us every 2 minutes. I understand that they are currently improving the parc by building more villas and that the vehicles are not allowed to exceed 10mph but the reason we chose a centre parcs holiday was so our toddlers could have more freedom. The vans usually only had 1 member of staff in but we couldn't help wonder why the staff didn't share instead of taking out 2 vans? Also - we have stayed at most of the centre parcs locations over the years and I have always seen staff riding bikes instead of driving vans.Maybe it was the location of our villas as it seemed we were also being passed by staff arriving/leaving for work and parking in the centre of the village. Surely there should be a service road or staff should have to park on the edge of the parc (like the visitors) and walk/cycle in? We used the swimming pool a few times which was great, the childrens' pool - Pirate Cove was amazing and the kids loved it! The water was lovely and warm too and I would definitely recommend hiring a cabana if you have kids, it just means you have somewhere to stop and catch your breath and let the kids eat lunch without worrying about them wondering off.  We also used the pottery painting, all the staff were really friendly and helpful and the pottery turned out great. A few of our party also hired out the boats and went out onto the lake, although they wanted to hire the pirate boats but were told they had all been booked out but there were actually sat empty and no-one turned up to use them which seemed unfair.When leaving the parc one of our party woke up at 6:30am and noticed there were 2 cars parked in the unloading bays outside our villa, they were still there when we collected our cars at 9:00. They belonged to visitors opposite us who had their own unloading bays which meant we had to parc at the end of the road and drag all our luggage down the road. I understand it a first come first served basis, but it is also a 1 hour maximum stay to ensure everyone can load their cars.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0
groupe_8,Little disappointing with cleanliness of lodge this time.  Oven pans were dirty (food still burnt on) and we had to clean them before we could use them.  The bathroom floor was awash with water when we arrived and I had to mop it before we could walk in.Also I have developed an internal infection and it has been diagnosed as possibly the water in the hot tub that is the source.  Perhaps you should test the water in the hot tub beside the exit pool for the rapids as this was the one that we used.  The tub did not look very inviting as there is a lot of rust marks around the bottom edge of the tiles.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0
groupe_8,"Me and my husband just came back from a 4 night stay at the Sherwood Forest Center Parcs. Overall our experiance was very good and we would definitely return again in the future. We stayed in executive lodge 44 which was amazing, we had a great view of the lake from our patio and was lovely to have BBQs every evening. Also the patio was extremely quite and private, the layout was really good and we couldn't see any of our neighbours - even the lodge windows were designed to give each patio maximum privacy. The lodge itself was very well equipt and had everything we needed for our stay. The only issue would be the small size of the lodge, but we did stay in a studio so we can't really complain (although I do wish the bedroom was bigger as it was difficult for 2 people to get ready in, and the wardrobe was too narrow to hang any clothes) - despite this the lodge was really nice, the lodge fireplace was defiantly an added bonus and the pacmarket sold 4 firodges for around ¬£10 which was very well priced, even compared to the discount stores we looked in prior to our arrival. I would probably recommend getting an executive lodge - these are supposed to be the newer ones but even these were outdated (we stayed at the Woburn forest Center Parcs hotel and this was a lot more modern) - there wasn't much to complain about but it was just abit tired looking. The patio was my favourite part and the bbq area (for disposable BBQs only) was an added bonus! The parking situation on check in and departure day was quite cramped, and it was difficult to find a parking space outside our lodge (but we did wake up later on departure day, so it's probably worth getting the car early) The supermarket itself was very well priced, although we did buy most of our groceries before we arrived. But it was very handy and stocked a large variety of food - I would definitely recommended the Krispy Kreme doughnuts! I think the overall facilities could be improved but the whole village had a nice clean feel to it, the staff were also very friendly! They are also updating the pool with a new slide which will make it even better! The rapids are also great, but unfortunately you are not able to take gopros on the slides. We also had great weather and was really nice to sit in the outside pool. The forester inn is also a really nice pub - it's over the other side of the village away from the main square and around a 10 minute walk around the lake. We sat outside and it had nice views over a lake. Overall I would recommend the village, however we have also visited the Woburn forest one which I think had a better feel to it (but it is a lot newer) so I'd probably recommended and stay in the Woburn forest one over this one.

The group coordinators who we booked activities through said for our spa day it'd be made nice for us with a glass of bubbly on arrival to celebrate..not a single thing. I really wouldnt mind but we come 6 or 7 times a year (many peak times like school hols and xmas) and don't receive anything back.

Many utensils missing and the heating upstairs didnt work so had to go and report it, obviously couldn't ring as no signal! The spa was lovely.

Slow service, waitress miserable as sin and the cheese sauce which was the highlight is now awful. Complete let down. Needless to say we didnt tip.

groupe_8,"After my last review &quot;Filthy Dirty Hovel&quot; I never intended upon ever re-visiting Elveden.However seeing that some brand &quot;new executive lodges&quot; were being built close to the village square ,we decided to try again with high expectations of our &quot;new accommodation&quot; (encouraged by the quite generous 20% discount by way of Center Parc vouchers for lack of planting and possible building noise)New Executive Lodge 854:The lodge was very new (we were not the first as implied) ,warm and comfortable. It quickly became evident that there were still problems with the cleanliness and maintenance of lodges . These faults were not any where near as bad as my last review but still disappointing. Water poured out of the bathroom  basin waste, broken and missing wine glasses, patio door handle falling off These were reported and to be fair very quickly dealt with. However whilst the lodge was new it appeared many of its contents were not eg Hairdryer filter partially blocked, well used pans etc. The kitchen utensils were very basic eg one wooden spoon and no tongs, one Pyrex oven dish, very limitedBy far the worst feature was the non stop convoy of delivery vehicles continually passing through what we now know to be the main access cross roads for delivery's !This happened all day from 7.00 am and a lot of the vehicles were being driven at what I would describe as dangerous speeds relative to children on bikes, this includes CP official vans! (see pics) These lodges are great for being near the village square but if you want peace and quiet ,no fumes,  and don't want to be awoken by trucks instead of the wildlife,pick another location! I have massive concerns regarding the 12 wheel tippers being used for the building works, small children on their bikes potentially within a few feet of being crushed! At no time did I see a Banksman assisting the drivers out side our lodge, poor signage meant several lorry's went the wrong way and had to turn around, this is not a responsible  attitude to the safety of children and adults alike that are on holiday ,nor fair on the drivers!As previously stated in my last review I still find the pricing structure extortiante ,lager ¬£5.85 per pint, a glass of coke ¬£3.20,a glass of lemonade ¬£3.20, a &quot;Cocktail&quot; ¬£7.20 ( these are simply spirits and a few bits thrown into the same glass with no resemblance to a &quot;true Cocktail&quot;.AVOID!One of the most annoying things is that CP still charge the same price for a child bike buggy as for the bike ,meaning a charge of ¬£62! How about being more &quot;generous&quot; in your thoughts CP towards parents ? (this issue does not affect me personally)All together we had a reasonable time but come on CP ther are enough complaints on here, surely you can see that your cleaning standards need attention and prices could be more realistic for a trapped consumer base.Will we return ? I think it will be many years, and I hope that CP may have listened more to the complaints and taken positive action to improve things, its a brilliant business concept tainted by greed and complacency, such a shame!",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0

groupe_8,"The lodge cleanliness left a lot to be desired. Fronts of cupboards were dirty, grill pan and oven pan dirty, high chair dirty with no straps, the carpets and floors were filthy, within 10 minutes of arriving 3 children had filthy socks, having been told to take their shoes off so as not to get dirt on the furniture, and our crawling baby looked like we had sent him up a chimney !!!. We vac swept and mopped the floors ourselves, not something I would expect to have to do having paid ¬£1388 for a weekend visit. We as a family have been coming to Centre Parcs for 28 years and have noticed standards dropping over this time. In the last 3 years we have visited Elevden twice and Sherwood once, each time at least 1 of our party has been ill with stomach upsets, 2 years ago it was 4 of us. We don't get tummy problems at home so I can only assume that cleanliness is not top of the agenda for the people who own CP, just profits. The facilities and activities as usual were great, and the staff at Sherwood were really friendly. Unfortunately this paled into insignificance when we came to leave the venue. We sat in a hot car with a screaming baby, he's not usually like this, and a poorly 4year old (upset tummy), on one of the hottest days this year, on the car park for one and a half hours, most of the time stationary, because the car park was grid locked. There was no one to be seen trying to rectify this mess.

groupe_8,"We checked in here friday Afternoon for a longweekend till monday, sadly Its sunday morning and I am sat at home. What an incredible disapointment center parcs was from the moment arriving till we had had enough and just come home a day early. We arrived friday afternoon and waited in a queue of traffic for booking which seemed to last forever, no problem though appreciate change over days are going to be busy.  We didn't really want to do anything first day and wanted to just get settled so had a walk up to the village square and had a walk round and got a feel for the place. Theres some building work going on as they expand but this is quietly tucked away from prying eyes. Our accomodation was a &quot;Duplex Penthouse Apartment&quot; whilst clean indside, the outside was a bit too shabby especially considering the premium price we were charged at well over ¬£650 for the weekend.  Anyway, night one we utlised their take away service &quot;Indian&quot; we had a toddler with us and goes to bed pretty early, anyhow this &quot;Indian&quot; takeaway shows up and I put it in &quot;inverted commas&quot; loosly as I can only describe the most disgusting food I have had to displeasure of eating, in fact we didn't eat, totally binned it off it was absolutly the worst meal I have set eyes upon, soggy, bland, sour, tastless and rank all rolled into one. ended up trotting up to the market they have with overpriced goods to grab something to cook ourselves, it comes to something that the pre packaged meals in the market they have are a billion times better than what was delivered.  Off to bed we went on ther first night, bed.... terrible.... like really bad tossed and turned all night didn't sleep a wink woke up feeling like crap. Day two: First thing in the morning got up to open the patio doors and the locked snapped off in my hand, thought I'd give reception a call to let them know as couldn't lock the door and didn't want to leave our stuff unsecured. 3 hours later handyman showed up without any parts to fix it and mentioned that he'd be back later to fix no time given just later, an hour after we called to chase up and he was back within about 10 mins, so basically 4 hours wasted on our day. After the lock was fixed had a walk round, apart from the swimming there is little else to do at center parcs that dont cost an innordinate amount of extra money, there are plenty of activities but expect to budget some serious ¬£¬£¬£'s for your entire trip if you want to do anything beside walk on roads and very short paths its totally taken the forest experince away that I remember as a kid in the 90's .  We were on the willow part of the parc in Appt 980, a fair trek if you're on foot and fancy a beer in the Forresters inn at the other end of the park. Been walking round all day and came back to the Appt, we'd booked for a meal at Hucks but didn't bother going as the little one had fallen asleep so &quot;ordered in&quot; again why did we bother..... I mean seriously.... terrible even worse than the first day. This time we had ordered &quot;Chinese&quot; takeaway. What arrived was some concocsion of vomit inducing food, the mrs and I binned it off again, what a waste. If you're seriously going to peddle pan asian food at least try to be a bit authentic, grey rice I mean grey......., the Thai red curry totally rancid sauce with undercooked veg and 1 lousey piece of chicken, would have my local thai resturant laughing.  The Mrs had Chicken in black bean wow how much salt do you need? My sincere advice to the management of this place, do some testing order some of the dishes try them then prompty sack anyone who is prepping  food because it's NOT FIT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. My Labrador who eats sheep crap on walks out would turn his nose up. Seriously.Went to bed again, worst night sleep I have had again, woke up packed my stuff and just came home a day ealy, couldn't hack it. Would I come here again ? No way pedro, I'd rather go to chernobyl and suffer radiation poisoining.... Enough said.

groupe_8,"We've been coming to Center Parcs for around 5 years, it was the first family holiday we took our (then) one-year-old on, and have returned at least annually or biannually since 2013 for short breaks.This was our first time at Sherwood, we live relatively close to the Whinfell site so had always opted for that one but fancied a change; having read how the sites ranked, Sherwood appears to be very popular.  I do think the Sherwood site is a little better overall than Whinfell's, we all preferred the pool and layout of the place overall.  The accommodation in Whinfell is slightly better, however, and it's the first time I've ever noticed any sub-par cleanliness -dust/cobwebs in the lodge.Two fantastic days, lovely surroundings, great pool, nice nature reserves and parks, the usual pancake house visit, etc.  Loved the man made beach, the weather was kind for us, too. The kids both enjoyed the captain's water challenge thing where they get to drive their own boats.A few general tips for making the most of center parcs we've picked on over the years:- Plan your activities beforehand, some are expensive, some are pretty much what you've otherwise pay outside the resort (bowling, pottery, etc.), you can check the prices and descriptions of everything beforehand and build up an itinerary. Look at what's good value. E.g. one of the less expensive things we did this time was building bird feeders - for ¬£7 you sit with a ranger for about 30 minutes and fill a wooden feeder, kids loved it, and you walk away with something fairly substantial.  We normally do the treasure hunts, the kids love those.- Balance eating in and out.  The restaurants and bars can be pricey, particularly if they're your only source of food for 3/4 days and there are a few of you. We've BBQ'd in the winter, and tend to eat out once or twice (plus obligatory pancake house visit) but eat in the rest of the time.  Parc Market prices are fine in my view, you're not going to do a weekly shop there, but for odds and ends, prices are reasonable - it's also one of the kids' highlights thanks to the trolleys.- Make the most of it - the place is beautifully kept, packed with nature and beautiful surroundings, enjoy's what's included for free!  Some of the parks are great, the pool complex deserves a daily visit, if you've got young children there tends to be nightly kids discos, etc.All in all, a great few days - CP has become a big park of our kids' lives growing up, they adore it every time.",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

We arrived at about 2.40 on Friday. We queued in the car to get to the arrival lodge for only about 5 mins. The car park was pretty rammed to drive around because so many staff &amp; guests were leaving but to find an actual space was easy.Our lodge wasn't far away from all the restaurant's &amp; swimming etc.We were in Cedar 237.On first impressions the front door could do with being looked at quite hard to lock &amp; unlock from the outside. The lodge was very clean &amp; tidy &amp; all things we needed inside. The only thing we didn't like was there wasn't really anywhere to put our clothes because the bedroom was so small. I kept my case on the table under the tv in the living room as it was the only big space I could keep it.There also wasn't any tyoe of door between the living room &amp; the bedroom showing how small the 1 bed lodges are. It was much nicer to be in the forest &amp; have an outdoor area as to me that's the centre parcs experience all the wildlife etc but it actually felt like we had more floor space when we were in the apartments. I would still pick the lodge though.Love the swimming - the rapids are amazing! The outdoor pool at this centre parcs is a lot better than some of the others.We took a full shop with us for breakfast &amp; 2 dinners as we had a table booked at Caf√© Rouge for the Saturday night.We did adventure golf, bowling &amp; football pool - all were lots of funny &amp; easy to find &amp; book etc.Our meal at Caf√© Rouge was lovely - defo recommend. We had a lovely server named Lorna who gave us 2 complimentary glasses of fizz as it was our anniversary. We did also have a lunch on Sunday in the sports caf√© as we were watching all the sports on the big screen. The broccoli &amp; cheese soup - to die for! Made breakfast Monday morning then left. Had a lovely time &amp; the weather was pretty good - only a little bit of rain on Sat night.

We loved the pool and rapids but it was so busy that my dad couldn't go in the water and risk getting hurt by anyone else. When we asked the swimming pool receptionist, she let us come into the swimming pool an hour before it opened so my dad could swim in the water without people being around, this generosity of a man who gave up an hour of his time to be the life guard, meant that my dad could swim for one last time in a pool.

There's a Sainsbury's about 3 minutes from the forest so you don't need to go to mad with shopping before you go. Get there at 10am you really can start your trip as soon as you arrive dispite not having your lodge yet. Try the pizza delivery (it was yummy).

The swimming pool was as fantastic as ever with the cyclone causing me to scream like a little girl the whole way down, and the rapids giving us endless moments of enjoyment.

Hucks was better than last time, and our host Lisa was brilliant, she really did look after us well and amended any mistakes without any issue, Lisa, thank you for your brilliant service with us.

The lodges look a bit grim on the outside, but on the inside they are brilliant, clean, tidy, showers are lovely (we stayed in executive lodges) the sauna was really nice too. But most praise has to be for Paula, the housekeeper. She felt like part of the group at the end. She got to know us well and wasn't pushy, but still did a brilliant job, as a group we really want her to be recognized (so much so that next time we stay, we will request lodges where she is housekeeping)I see a lot of bad press about Center Parcs, and the pricing, but I really feel there is so much to do that you cannot get bored, and therefore its worth the price, however if these prices increased, I would question the value.

Best of all, although there was another right next door,our view both back and front was only of trees and the patio was not overlooked at all. 2) The wooded setting is very well kept and managed. We enjoyed the nature hut and the wildlife.3) We spent a lot of time in the subtropical swimming venue. The range of pools, slides etc were ideal for all ages and our little ones loved it. We also felt it was well organised with plenty of lifeguards and buoyancy aids to keep people safe.4) We didn't engage with many other activities (only the pedalos) but again we could see that there would be plenty for people of all ages.

It was two adults and a infant (2years old just) After reading reviews on here I was bit worried I had made a mistake booking! And would regret it or have a bad time :( ..  however I was wrong we had really good time and I guess everyone's views are always different. We booked a standard lodge pine 242!  It was fine for us and had everything we needed  the bed was ok but then we had just bought our selfs a brand new bed at home so was used to that hehe but it was sleepable for the week :).. my LG loved the animals visiting every morning or afternoon.. only down side was the pressure of the shower there was barly any :(.. Swimming pool was amazing and we would always visit 5-6pm as this was so quiet as we learnt. We did go once really early and ended up leaving early so it was so busy but think because the weather outside was not great.  We did few activity's did mucky pups which is hour and my LG got bit bored after half and hour 45 mins..  we did the entertainment as it was only a pound. We also did the treasure trail which we really enjoyed as we got to see all park finding things we hadn't couple days before..  we did painting twice lol as my LG enjoyed it. Yes it is not cheap as you pay for the time and then the pottery.   We didn't eat out all time but we did a few  yes expensive and is a let down cos last thing wanna do is cook on holiday.. however it is what it is and you budget for your selfs I mean you can do it on a budget and plan  but you might as well just do a caravan holiday and enjoy free entertainment.. there is not much night entertainment but there is a kids disco which my LG loved :).. however for us it was something  we could tick off our done list.. ,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

Experience in sub-tropical was very disappointing; staff attitude was such that you felt as though you were intruding on their day, we were made to feel as though they were doing us a favour, customer skills left a lot to be desired. I had cause to complain to duty manager? (person at kiosk) on the Sunday night as lifeguards and other staff (contractors?) where removing items (chairs/high chairs/cribs/display cabinets/shelving) from the cabana area from 19:30 until around 21:00, items where been removed to the rear of the cafeteria area, there was no consideration for people relaxing or for their safety, i.e. children running around as a convoy of staff moved the items, people were taking avoiding action to prevent collision, one life guard was in such a hurry he ran into myself as i walked to the pool (i am a big guy so he bounced of me) he gave a slight apology before moving off to carry on moving items. at one point a shelving unit tippled and could have fallen onto a family group sat adjacent to the Jacuzzi when they moved a display cabinet a lady in a wheelchair was in there way the staff just moved her to one side and carried on moving the cabinet, it did not look as though they asked if she could move? I complained the staff at the kiosk but they were dismissive. On the final day (Monday) we witnessed contractors laying tarmac type surface at the bike park next to the crazy golf, while gaining access some heras panels blew over onto a lady on a bike with her small child in the rear trailer, she was very distressed, workers seemed more concerned with re securing the panels that the lady who was very shaken and crying!

groupe_8,"Arrived on Friday 2nd March for Weekend with family. We still enjoy our holidays here but there are always issues. Snow had started to thaw on the Friday/Saturday but they still seemed short staffed. All the issues we had were dealt with it's just a shame they always happen. We were told on arrival we would have to make up our own beds but housekeeping came to do it before we had chance. We had a yoga activity cancelled, another activity which was to involve a 4 year old was moved from 3.30pm to 8.30pm on our itinerary despite us having confirmation of the earlier booking, customer services said they'd ring us back about it but never did. Onsite customer services compensated us with free bowling which was appreciated but I got the impression they didn't believe us, they just kept saying it couldn't happen. The online booking terminals were shutdown, the lift to upstairs bar and soft play was closed for the whole weekend, the cashpoint was out of order. My grandson was turned away from a pedal car activity because he was 1 week away from his fourth birthday which our fault for booking it, we just hoped they'd overlook it.. Sunday lunch in the Country Club was quite poor, I thought it was edible but three of our party didn't eat theirs at all, although we didn't complain the staff discounted our bill because they'd noticed the uneaten food. Our lodge was clean and perfectly ok for our needs, the Swimming Pool area was warm and not overcrowded, the food that we had in the sports bar was very good and all the staff we interacted with were excellent.We've been going at least once a year for 25 years with children and now Grandchildren and for us the Positives still outweigh the negatives but I'm not sure they will for much longer.",1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0

As always, I read reviews before we book or go anywhere, so I was surprised at what I read.... expensive shops and restaurants, tired accommodation, overcrowding, packed changing rooms. In any case we booked, four adults and 1 infant, my 6 month old grandson, On our way to the site we stopped in at Morrison's in Newark (16 miles away) and got our supplies for the week. Upon arrival, check in was simple and straightforward and we were handed our lodge keys. Both my wife and I being disabled we were allowed to park near to our chalet and leave the cars there for the whole of our stay with blue badges on display. We weren't allowed into our chalet but we had a lovely walk through the forest with our grandson and enjoyed a lovely Starbucks, before we walked back at about 2-30 pm to find our lodge ready to enter. It was lovely, very spacious, spotlessly clean and very well appointed. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook our evening meals and was well laid out. The bedrooms were a good size and actually very comfortable. It was a perfect base. We hired a cycle and trailer for our grandson who enjoyed being pulled along in it. The process of hire, pickup and return is also very simple. As you would expect the sub-tropical swimming area is the jewel in the crown, our grandson loved it as did we. At any time of day, it never felt over crowded and he got to bounce along happily in his swim float whilst we took turns on the grand cascade and wild water rapids. Great fun. The whole place really let us wind down and have a lovely relaxing holiday. We stayed in lodge 582, accessed by a small flight of stairs and was literally about a 5 - 10 minute walk away from the village centre. Even with rain a couple of days it didn't spoil our fun and enjoyment. One one thing stopped me giving it 5 stars was that there were not enough little baby swings dotted around the park. A few more free facilities like this would build upon the great offering. With regards to prices on the site, the shop prices are very similar to your local corner shop. A bit more expensive but nothing too exorbitant. Bowling (great fun) was actually cheaper that our AMF bowling alley at ¬£22 per hour per lane. We managed to get in 2 and a half games, so great value for money. We didn't try the restaurants as we bought everything before hand. We really had a fantastic family holiday and we will most definitely be back, probably in a bigger group next time. It was amazing.

Then late morning after we had set off got an email saying due to bad weather CP would allow rebooking - too late for us.My review will not cover the good bits, thousands of other reviewers have already done this, but just the bits I felt were below reasonable expectation.Maybe bad weather and staff shortage affected our visit?, but this is how it was for us.  Check in was very slow, queued about 30 mins, and would seem to be what they expect judging by the road length for queuing traffic.Staff spoke to each driver in turn asking for booking details then walked back to the office for 5 mins to collect leaflets and wristband keys.They must have used a device in the office to encode the keys. As car reg was already provided on-line why not use ANPR to have everything ready as each car reaches the check in gate?Lodge was ok but could easily have been better, outside paint was grubby, inside decor shabby, bath dirty. There was a chalkboard but just a dish of stubby little bits of used chalk, almost too small to hold, How difficult is it to put a new box of chalks in the room?. Kitchen area was modern and mostly ok, but look a bit harder and the need for a deep clean was obvious. Lounge and beds comfortable. Bath towels too thin. Windows were really dirty, normal dirt plus big splash marks. Nothing was disgusting, but nothing was Wow!The paved path to the lodge was uneven with no proper edging, easy to trip.Lighting around the site was very poor, signage was small and hard to see in low light levels. Car park to Lodge was about 10 mins walk, why not design car parking areas closer to the lodges, would avoid the long queues driving to the lodge, then having to drive again back to the car park, then repeat the whole process again on departure day. Not much fun on leaving to join a traffic jam on site just to get from the lodge to the main exit, took us 15 mins, reason was a single wristband dropoff box, come on CP, do Sainsbuyrs have just one checkout.We encountered a payment problem in a restaurant, we were accidentally overcharged, genuine error, staff apologetic and very pleasant in trying to rectify it, I thought a simple card refund/ transaction void followed by a new transaction would sort it out but Not. It took 15 minutes for two staff to fail to achieve this, and in the end they refunded us the overcharge on a card with cash from the till. Extraordinary! Either the till system or staff training needs improvement, good thing we were happy to wait .We visited Cafe Rouge for the coffee and cake deal only to be told they had  available about six slices of two different cakes, Very disappointing. Swimming was as expected from the brochure, but perhaps due to the weather was crowded and the buggypark was full up, thats probably 50 buggys, not much fun sorting it out. Sports bar was ok, but with multiple big screens showing different channels all with sound it was distracting trying to enjoy just one match, surely a better design could improve the enjoyment level by minimising unwanted sound.In one restaurant the table top was sticky, we tried cleaning with a babywipe but were told by a member of staff that the tables had lost their varnish and would not wipe clean, Many of the menus we used were very sticky and unpleasant to handle.

The accommodation was a little tired in places (especially compared to the new exec lodges we stayed in at Whinfell) but adequate for what we needed and reflected the price we paid. The lodge backed onto a stretch of water so we had lots of beaked visitors at our patio door which was thoroughly entertaining for our baby.This time we didn't book many activities apart from the electric boat but we made good use of the walks around (recommended by the knowledgeable ranger) and also the swimming pool. I liked the pool set up but did find the changing facilities to be quite grubby under foot. Anything that dropped onto the changing room floor got covered in dirty water. I also think it would be great if Sherwood could introduce the wristband technology at other parks. I imagine this is already in planning somewhere down the line.We had a number of visits to Starbucks and Parc Market. We also dined at Cafe Rouge, Pancake House and ordered takeaway from Dining In. We experienced cheery customer service wherever we went and the layout of the Village was nice. The pancakes were good and we believe we were completely justified in having two stacks of 'chocoholics' pancakes for lunch.  The other meals we ate out/ordered were very average but no great disasters either. The free baby food pouches is a nice touch however my son has been baby led weaned and prefers finger foods so he wasn't a huge fan however the waitress at Cafe Rouge kindly brought us over some peas and sweet corn free of charge instead when I asked for a side of veg. As more and more babies are going down the finger food route, it would be great I think if the restaurants could openly offer an alternative if within their means to do so.Unfortunately our baby boy fell ill the last couple of days of our stay.  We visited the medical nurse and saw Nurse Lucy who was lovely. She did a thorough examination of our son and rightly advised that we go to hospital.  Sadly we were admitted into hospital for further investigations and couldn't finish the remainder of our stay.  My husband called the duty manager to see if we could extend our lodge.  Unfortunately we were told that the park was fully booked and they could only extend checkout by two hours. This was disappointing and didn't help our situation a great deal. We were also somewhat dubious that all of the lodges were fully occupied (out of school holiday season) however we appreciate it if that was the case. Nevertheless it would have been nice to have been offered an area for housekeeping to put all our belongings until we were out of hospital or at least until the end of the day to alleviate some of our stress. I am sure we will return to Center Parcs again as we've had great family holidays before and look forward to going again as our son gets older. Sherwood is a lovely site and would be great for most families as it is easy to get around however sadly for us we probably won't visit again too soon as our holiday ended a bit sour and we felt management could've helped us a little bit more.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

Prices are relatively cheap if you are a family from an area of the country where paying ¬£40 for a breakfast is normal.The problem I have here is that when deals are offered on villas then the type of customer this appeals to is not the same, this just creates noise around pricing and clouds the reality.I live local, like less than a mile away and have visited many times and it has always been a brilliant experience, you don't even know you are so close to home.It seems to me that for people paying a premium for the u201cextrasu201d once they have had a good deal that it's easy to see why they would feel ripped off.

The customer service lady told me that &quot;she had to cancel a holiday as her daughter was unwell and her insurance didn't cover it&quot; I think it's very unprofessional that she's even mentioned this to me and it didn't help my personal circumstances and wasnt even the same situation as ours. As you can imagine as a young family we don't have lots of disposable income so our yearly center parcs holiday is quite a big deal. I just feel very dissapointed that we  spend almost  ¬£1000 plus we always book spa and restaurant and lots of activists so are putting a lot of money into the company's every year and this is how we get treatedAlso our villa was absolutely filthy, we had to get someone to come and reckless it, other than all of this the weekend was enjoyable as always before everything else happend",1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,0.0,

I also can see the change in the business model and I totally take on board that any business has to plan for a changing market place. I just feel that it is moving away from what I like. No floatation pool anymore but a 'pirate cove' or similar. No snooker tables yet more pool tables. More kid facilities and less for the adult with no kids. More villas being built yet no more lockers. The prices go up with drink prices very expensive. A well stocked super market at waitrose prices yet not the quality. Foresters restaurant was just awful and the lovely waitress offering a 20% discount looked generally down beat. The varnish is starting to flake and the ethos of what was a lovely holiday is now becoming over commercialised and left me thinking as I threw my green wristlet into the collecting bin on my way out would this be my last visit?It might well be.",1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0

groupe_9,"I'd agree with a lot of the reviews recently submitted. It's a great place but very expensive and needs some tweaks. Accommodation was good. (Willow 2-story lodge 974.) Good sized bedrooms and fairly well presented. Everything you could need! We could park outside our lodge which isn't commonplace on site but is about 10-15 walk to the main village.Pool is good. Couple of slides which are pretty decent. Rapids are hilarious but you are likely to bruise yourself as it's very rough. Cabanas although expensive are great for families with young children. Towels, a soft drink each and a quiet place  to change is helpful. (Do bear in mind you have to check in inside the pool area and you're still clothed which looks odd.)We ate at Bella, Hucks, Dexters, Pancake house and Forresters over our stay. Yes they are expensive and overpriced for the quality generally BUT service was always really friendly! And pancake house (which you can't prebook is amazing!) All restaurants are very family friendly and some provide Ellas pouches/Heinz jars. Ample high chairs but a little to big for smaller babies (our 7month old struggled in them)Spa is very expensive but very worth it!!Negatives:The site is very busy with vehicles and some rude cyclists who whizz around. Main carpark is full of people who selfishly park across 2 spaces. On arrival, despite speaking several times to center parcs, one heavy wooden cot was left at the bottom of the stairs for us to carry up, and one cot we had to phone up for. We had been told more than once that both would be ready for us. Not a great start. (The additional cot was a travel cot and no bedding is provided for them)Lastly the pool changing rooms are horrendous! Hope these get updated in the current and upcoming works. It's so confusing with changing rooms having doors in and out of your cubical. There are very few baby changing/family changing and the couples changing rooms are tiny!!! There is no system so you have to wander around aimlessly until you get lucky. It's so hot in there and leads to lots of very upset babies and children.

The downsides...Swimming areas were far too busy - which is only going to be added to once the new villas have been completedMain swimming pool and all slides were shut at 7pm on Sunday evening putting immense pressure on the remaining item that was open - the rapids. We went later to try and find a quieter period to swim to no avail.Building work throughout the site - spoiling the tranquillity and relaxation of the holiday Mouse in the house (well Villa) - during our stay which had a nibble of our potatoes and cereals. That said we were reimbursed for these items but the mouse issue was ongoing and when the customer service team came to lay traps they didn't think to clear up the mouse droppings.Activities are so expensive - whilst I appreciate some activities require high levels of staffing. They could make the cheaper activities i.e. crazy golf, ten-pin bowling, badminton, KataKanu more affordable for families.Food and Drink is very expensive - come on Centre Parcs just because you have a captive audience doesn't mean you have to completely take advantage. The reason we visit Center Parcs every year is due to the range of activities which are children love and we used to find the short break relaxing but sadly on this occasion it did not deliver.For the first time ever I'll be looking at alternatives for this holiday.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,

This is our second time of coming here and wow what a completely different opinion I have this time round. We loved it last time we came (2 years ago) but this time round it was a real eye opener with how much they don't care for their guests and how money orientated they really are.Our accommodation was clean &amp; tidy when we arrived so this was good. The downside to the accommodation was the heating system. It automatically turns itself off after a certain amount of time so every morning we woke up freezing as the heating turned itself off overnight - it stayed in its minuses all week and hit -7 degrees one morning.All outdoor activities were cancelled due to bad weather conditions, restaurants were closing early due to the lack of staff &amp; the subtropical pool had the rapids, kids pool &amp; cyclone closed early also to the lack of staff. Now I know the weather is out of Center Parcs control but there was no apology or even hope of the situation getting any better. The cherry on the cake was how they dealt with changeover day (people leaving &amp; coming on the friday). The local police advised not to drive as it is unsafe on the roads but despite this warning, Center Parcs were not having any of it and wouldn't let you extend your stay by an extra night. Their response was to get a B&amp;B nearby or book a whole weekend at Center Parcs at the normal full price - Wow. Heyho, I will try and end on a positive. We did Birds Of Prey on the first day and the man who host this was very nice and informative so I recommend this activity. The indian restaurant and pancake house on site was very nice and recommend The Rajinda Experience as it's definitely worth the money.I'll end on if you are looking to book Center Parcs then all I say is book for the summer/spring/autumn months as you will not be looked after when things go wrong &amp; out of the normal.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0

groupe_9,"Ive heard many good things about center parcs that i thought id try it with my family. We got a 3 bed lodge for 6 people and 1 toddler for 5 days for roughly ¬£500. Which can be quite alot of money compared to other holiday sites ive been too. Ill start off with the positives of this holiday. The lodge is quite a good size! 3 Bedrooms with each room having its own bathroom. A living room combined with a kitchen and a sauna. Cuttlery, plates, pots and pans included. Most lodges arnt too close together so privacy is a great. My lodge wasnt too far away from activities and dining areas. The swimming complex is amazing. Many slides for people of all ages. There are many pools also for people of mamy ages. The swimming complex includes an outdoor pool which has rapids. The main pool has a wave machine and areas labled for compitent swimmers. There are eating areas within the complex and a small shop to buy swimming items such as arm bands and rubber rings. The center parcs site has a fair number of shops that include: Clothes shops, sweet shops and a supermarket. There are a couple of starbucks on site. The site is quite big so outdoor activities and cycling is a great idea especially since sherwood pines is a short cycle away. The staff and security on site are friendly and great to speak to about anything that the site have to offer. The site has maids that come and give your lodge a clean on a daily basis and provide new bed linin and towels. They do such an amazing job to keep the lodge up to scratch and clean. The views and suroundings are amazing and great to wake up to.Now to the downsides to Center Parcs:Unlike most holiday destinations, you cant park your car infront of your lodge. You have a certain time to get your car to your lodge, empty your car and take your car back to a big car park near the entrance to center parcs where it will stay unless you are packing to leave and going off site. I find this to be frustrating because of having to walk back and forth to the car when i need it can be a pain. Ouside the lodges there are parking bays. The parking bays arnt big enough for everyone to park and unload. I had to park my car, somehow, halfway in a ditch and hold on for life trying to get out of my car. Very frustrating. Yes the site has alot of activitiea to do and they sound amazing but they are quite overpriced and expensive so i didnt do much on site. Swimming is free yes but i am limited to going at certain times as it can get busy. The rapids can be quite dangerous so please be careful. The rapids have humps on the floor and i was going down the rapids at an average speed and ended up hitting my hip off the hump and bruiseing my hip. There are quite a number of changing facilities but not enougj family changing rooms. I am constantly waiting for a family changing room to be available and i dont think there are enough of them especially since majority of people here are familys. If you plan on making food in your lodges, id recomend going to a supermarket before coming on site. The onsite supermarket is very. very very expensive. Its not bad to buy a 4 pint milk but thats it. I find myself going off site tp get odd bits from tesco which is 3 miles down the road. The site has a resturant which on menu looks amazing and price wise isnt too bad. But we were told the waiting time would be a while and my 16 month old couldnt wait an hour for food. So we ended up going off site and brought back an indian takeaway (2 miles away) which worked out less than the resturant on site. Overall:Center Parcs is a nice relaxing place, full of friendly people, adventures and activities but... At a price.

groupe_9,"We stayed in Elveden forest over the recent February half term.The accommodation was good overall. A few niggles were sorted quickly. The heating works well. The windows next to the beds however need draught seals. It appears that the security locks that have been retrofitted cause the window to be open a crack which causes an icy breeze.The forest setting was lovely as ever. Most cabins are designed so you look into the forest from the living and can hardly see any other buildings. There is a lot of wildlife- deer, squirrels and many bird species. The swimming pool facility is excellent, the kids love it. The one thing I would like to see is a modest sized exercise pool for doing lengths.Elveden is particularly flat so suits cycling for children. I was rather disappointed in the level of traffic Tues-Thurs all around the residential areas. At least 1 car per minute throughout most of the day. This was all maintenance, cleaners, deliveries to the builders etc. While they did obey the speed restrictions, it detracted from the safe environment, having to get the toddler off the road every time. Please be aware of this Center Parcs as it is a key selling point of your offering.There were some electric vehicles but they can still run you over...There are loads of activities available if you are that way inclined. We spent over ¬£50 for my wife and daughter to go on the shorter tree trekking course. It's well designed and fun, but amounts to circa 25 minute's action so is quite pricey.There are numerous restaurants to choose from, with large menus. Which is good. And plenty of cafes.Pricing is on the high side, think London tourist area i.e. ¬£14 burger and chips. Quality of food and service is what I would call &quot;high street chain&quot;. It's nice enough but don't expect gourmet.Overall Center Parcs is an enjoyable and relaxing holiday, and ideal in Winter due to the swimming facilities. We hope to come again. My main concern is that due to a lack of quality competition in the UK they are managing demand with high pricing. In winter (except Xmas and New Year) and outside the other school holidays it is just about affordable (circa ¬£150 per night for a 2 bed lodge), but in the school hols I am not exaggerating when I say they are competing with top class 5 star London hotels on price (¬£250-¬£400 per night).",0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

There are many activities that are completely free: the pool and the slides, loads of playgrounds, nature trail, all the walks you can do, kids disco, adults disco and many others. We chose to do activities with our son who is under 3 years old (we went on a boat on the lake which he loved as it reminded him of Peppa Pig), little sports class where he couldn't stop laughing playing tennis, bikes rental, sensory den and some other. Apart from that we loved how private the lodges felt. Even though they are next to each other, somehow you feel really close to nature and away from the city hussle and other people. It seems really quiet. We had the log fire overnight and that felt very romantic. The food delivery was pricer than your average take out but it was also way better quality.

I think it was nearly ¬£700 for Friday-Monday and you check in at 3 pm on the Friday and check out Monday 10am.Our room was dirty. Blood on one of the floors and blood on my quilt and door handle. Everything is so expensive including the alcoholic drinks ¬£17.00 for 3 pints. Ridiculous.I think it is a bit of a novelty compound, unless you have lots of money you can only walk and swim. Everything else is charged so wont be returning.I guess great for kids but cars and bikes share most of the same roads so have to be careful. We visited The restaurant Foresters INN was basically a poor Wetherspoons. Dry burgers and chips and food took ages to come cost ¬£16 for a average burger.Not a great experience at all.

groupe_9,"In a way it pains me to write this review. We have been to a Center Parcs 4 times in the last 5 years.We really enjoyed this visit too, but it may be our last.The Good, our accommodation was excellent and spotlessly clean. The sub tropical paradise was great fun and as always the highlight of our holiday, especially the rapids.The staff are as usual were very friendly and helpful.The bad, the activities are very overpriced. For example as a family we did archery, which cost ¬£95 for a family of 4 for 1 hour. Then when you arrive you are put into pairs and have to share a target, thus reducing you activity time to half. So effectively you pay ¬£95 for half a hour of archery. Extortionate and sheer greed on the part of Center Parcs. The supermarket has a captive market, but do their prices really need to be so high? All the restaurants are expensive, I remember in past there being offers in the restaurants and the Sports Cafe. No offers anymore, we ate in 2 restaurants during our visit and they were virtually empty, I wonder why?The ugly, the communal changing room at the swimming pool was not very clean. An example of this being on one occasion when I got changed to go into the pool there were 2 coke cans which had been spilt on the seating area, 3 hours later after our swim they were still there. I suspect someone is not doing their job properly. Why do they continue to build more lodges, making the sites over populated. This is in particular making the swimming pool very overcrowded at times and on occasions the rapids are boarding on dangerous, they are so busy.The only explanation is sheer greed on the part of Center Parcs.Another example of this is having to pay up to ¬£60 to pick a lodge nearer the centre. Why not make it a reward for those that book early. The come back offer really is an insult, a ¬£25 voucher, when you are booking a holiday that cost anything between ¬£800 and ¬£1100. How about a proper discount of 10%, that would be more of an incentive.My teenagers really want to return to Longleat next year, but I am definitely having second thoughts.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,0.0

You can however park in the main car park from 10.00 am and use the facilities, but you cannot get to your cabin until 3.00 pm.Cabin was well equipped for self catering, and shop on site provides most things you will need if you forget to bring coffee, tea, washing up liquid etc plus most food if you want to self cater. Cabin was a refurbished one, but maintenance was poor with a number of minor problems - annoying when you are paying top dollar.Very good sub-tropical paradise pool with lots of slides and other features - this is the best bit as it is included free although quite busy!Lots of other activities to do but all rather expensive. However you just have to take a deep breath and pay up, and they are well organised.They claim to insist that all cars are returned to the main car park after unloading, so we did, but I wish we had not bothered doing so. Although they came round during the first night putting (very unobtrusive) notes on cars that were left in the unloading bays there was no follow up action or enforcement. Of course that meant that when people came to load up on departure the bays were still occupied by cars that had been there all weekend. There should be clear signage as you drive in saying that cars can only brought onto site for an hour to unload, and bright penalty notices and proper enforcement action taken against those who flout the rules so that those who keep to the rules do not feel that they are the suckers!Guest Services were very helpful, both during our stay and later when they had to send an item we left behind to us by post (at cost) within a couple of days.We did enjoy ourselves (Grandparents, parents and grandchildren), but I am not sure would go back, especially not in school holidays when prices are sky high.

There was a lack of car parking spaces, probably due to the number of new cabins being built. The cabin we stayed in was a new build. It was lovely, very clean and modern. Every kitchen utensil you would need is supplied. Beds a little hard for some. We hired bikes for the weekend and found plenty of lovely places to cycle around. We noticed that there was much more traffic at Sherwood though. People are obviously not sticking to the no vehicle rule. People parked their cars outside and left them all weekend and people were travelling  around the village in their cars. By Sunday we were wanting something to do, to find that most activities were already booked up. We queued for crazy golf for 20 mins to be told it was too busy and to return later. The swimming pool area is undergoing an upgrade. I wish I'd known this when I booked. The area left to swim in is too small for the number of guests even if you go late on. When we came out of the pool we had to queue for a changing room as they were all taken. The area was dirty and run down. On the Friday we called at The  Forresters for a snack and a drink. A very average sandwich was ¬£10 and a bottle of Budweiser over ¬£5.  It was very disappointing. We had pre booked for Sunday lunch which was just under ¬£15 a head. This was much better and the sweets lovely too. Bella Italia seemed to have a very limited menu, some food was good but some was no better than a Birds Eye meal but costing nearly ¬£15.00. Would we return? Probably not to Sherwood, Whinfell in my opinion is  much better. I think we'll give Center Parcs a break for a bit.

It was expensive, we categorically stated 3 times no cucumber and guess what they put it on all the sandwiches, well if you can cal them that.  Basically for 2 people there was one 3 tier tray.  Bottom tray was 2 plain scones and tiny pot of jam.  2nd tier was 3 slices of plain white bread cut into 6 tiny squares.  I should point out at this stage the 6 tiny squares originally consisted of 2 egg, 1 chicken and cucumber, 1 smoked salmon and cucumber, 2 cheese and cucumber and tomato.  The 2nd tray they brought out had 3 egg and 3 cheese. Apparently as we specified no cucumber they could not remake the teeny squares without it!!!! The top tier had 2 mini macaroons, 2 teeny weeny squares of lemon drizzle and 2 micro squares of chocolate cake.  Plus one cup of tea each.  We were so disappointed.  It was the poorest and most expensive tea ever!Onto the spa, the ice caves were broken as were a couple of other areas.

The rest of the comments on Tripadvisor I can concur with, yes it is expensive, but if you've paid a few hundred quid for just four nights in a pre-fab lined with wood planks why moan about how expensive a burger and a pint of lager is? The facilities in the chalets are ok though and thee beds comfortable.My overall view is that the parc is still worth a visit, particularly if noise doesn't bother you, maybe book a chalet at the north east part of the site which may be a little quieter.

It was worth the extra money for daily housekeeping and fresh towels on the Wednesday. There were a mixture of families and couples, and family groups/friends. It was not a school holiday so apparently u201cquietu201du2026 I shan't visit in peak season then! Still plenty of screaming children and aggressive buggy pushers. Our lodge was in the Oak area, not too far to walk to all of the activities/village square; if any further you'd need bikes.It was NOT a cheap trip. We thoroughly exhausted ourselves doing lots of activities... field archery, crossbows, yoga class, indoor climbing, aerial trekking &amp; aerial adventure (basically low and high ropes, finished with a long zip wire over the lake), mini golf, quad biking, segways. Highly recommend them all. (Don't do the climbing unless you're ready for your arms to ache!)We visited Tesco before arriving (avoid buying all your groceries from the shop in the village; for example in Tesco a honeydew melon is ¬£1.80, at ParcMarket it was nearly ¬£4). We had one snack, one lunch and one dinner out. They were overpriced but adequate. I wouldn't bother visiting the Pancake House again (lunch); it was a bit stodgy. The Sports Cafe was very pleasant (snack); we had beer, cocktails and chips after the zip wire. The Indian was nice enough (dinner) but cost about ¬£60 for 1 starter, 2 mains, 2 rice, 2 beers and 1 cocktail.Good things...+ I got on the quad bikes and then decided I really didn't want to do it... they were very understanding and offered to book me on a different activity/refund. I took the refund. No hassle. Exemplary customer service.+ Housekeepers were very good and the lodge was clean and tidy on arrival and each day after they came.+ I felt safe in the hands of the instructors. Of particular mention was a chap who helped me in the aerial adventure (he had a beard; I didn't catch his name). He was patient and encouraging, and not judgemental. Emily also for making us feel safe when getting us kitted up. And a chap I think called Chris (or could have been Simon?) who we had for crossbows and Segways, he had great banter and was again, encouraging and enthusiastic.+ The restaurant staff were friendly and helpful.+ We had a pizza takeaway delivered u2013 arrived exactly when it was promised. Ordering over the telephone was easy.+ Beds were comfy. Linen, towels and duvet all clean and warm.Some negatives...- Exceptionally poor signposting!!! There are hundreds of signs and signposts and most of them are useless! We found multiple signposts that pointed you to nowhere! Trying to get from the Country Club to the Outdoor Activity Centre was a nightmare; the signpost pointed you towards a carpark dead-end. There were few signposts to get you from the village square back to lodges, but usefully lots of signs to get you to the places you could spend more moneyu2026- Price. Cost of the lodge isn't horrific, so if you were to go and stay in a basic lodge and take your own food and entertainment then the break is okay price-wise. I understand paying for instructors and facilities for certain things, e.g. archery, and the price was reasonable, but some things were taking the p***. E.g. ¬£3.20 to have pizza delivered ¬£6.75 for 9 hole mini golf (as comparison, costs about ¬£5 for 18 holes in Hunstanton)¬£2 for towel hire (1 towel) at the pool20p for swimming costume drier at the pool¬£2 for one game of pool- Many of the staff used the response u201cperfectu201d rather than u201cokayu201d or u201cyesu201d, sometimes inappropriatelyu2026 u201cHave you booked a table?u201d u201cNou201d u201cPerfect, please wait a minuteu201d...

The girl at the booking desk took my name and address and other activities done and said she'd post the rest. Just because I'm an adult doesn't mean I don't want my pin of victory!- Aircraft noise (not sure where from, but multiple military bases in Norfolk). You get used to it but it is a little intrusive.- Lots of building work. No direct inconvenience but clear that Center Parcs wants to pack more people in without increasing capacity in other areas.Suggestions for Center Parcs:- Review ALL signposts and remove/amend as necessary.- Add a warning on to the Elveden page about aircraft noise.- Provide more information in advance of bookingu2026 it is very difficult to find out what activities are available and what they cost before booking.- Make more activities free or reduce price to level comparative to sports centres and seaside towns, e.g. mini golf, court hire, changing facilities at hotels.- Ensure pin badges for activities are available.Advice for travellers:- Go for a lodge that has a housekeeping service.- If far away from the village square, take or rent bikes.- Try the Segway experience u2013 its great fun!- Don't do more than 2 paid for activities per dayu2026 they're fun but exhausting!- Take towels with you to use at the pool so you don't have to hire them.- Food shop before you arrive.",0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,

Our most recent trip was Easter weekend. 4 adults and 2 young children. We always book a cabana when visiting the subtropical pool. It's never cold, you don't have to worry about towels, drinks, relaxing in private should you wish to take a break. Totally worth the money in my opinion - book as early as you can as they sell out quickly. We booked a new executive lodge which was more than adequate for our needs and clean as always. We paid to check in early at 2pm which avoided the rush and we paid extra to secure a maple area (close to all the amenities) My only tips would be, take your own logs for the fire. Bring your own bird food for the wildlife.We had a wonderful Sunday carvery at Hucks where the staff went above and beyond for my son who didn't cope well with the noise of the jazz band they had playing, so moved us to a more suitable table.Loved the new aerial adventure...250m zip across the lake ud83dude06.

This was our first family holiday with our 7 month old daughter, and we found it to be a very family friendly and welcoming place to bring a baby.Our Woodland Lodge was well appointed and offered everything we needed to have a relaxing and enjoyable stay. The only things missing were a baking tray and then some sort of lower or dimmable lighting in the lounge area, as the overhead lights were quite loud when it came to the evening.All the restaurants and facilities had welcoming and friendly staff, and made us all feel comfortable being there. The only thing we found a bit difficult was having to ensure our baby wasn't napping when we wanted to visit a restaurant, as buggies had to be left in buggy parks outside.The Subtropical Swimming Paradise was amazing, and it was our daughter's first time swimming and she loved it. We particularly enjoyed taking her early one morning for the Dolphins session for younger children before the older ones were allowed it. It would be good if these sessions could be more frequent during the week, and better advertised, as we only found out about them through an Aquatique staff member, and this was unfortunately only once we'd already missed a session.The woodland was wonderful to walk around with a buggy, and there was plenty of wildlife and fresh air to make us feel relaxed and like we'd had a really good holiday.

We have worked out we have been 15 times in the past in total. On arrival our lodge was clean and tidy except the plugs in the kitchen didn't work - so the kettle and coffee machine didn't work. We contacted the guest services who were very helpful and they sent over someone to sort it out. We were out getting the bikes hired ( the price has gone up again - take your own) . When we got back 2 of the sockets worked but the rest still didn't. On going out to a meal at Hucks dinner, we tried to switch the outside lights on - they didn't work either so my friend checked the fuse box and saw the fuse was off so he switched it on. Not only the lights didn't now work - it's very dark at night,- the sockets all stopped working again! The smell of damp in our bathroom meant we kept the fan on all day so the smell didn't affect our sleep at night. After an expensive meal at Hucks (¬£70a couple) and astounding bar prices at the bar (cheaper to buy a drink in London) we went back to the lodge after re-reporting the electrics, to find no external,lights worked front or back. But our faithful 2 sockets were working again.That night we left the heating on at 20 oC but the heating is centrally controlled apparently and went down to 14 oC overnight which for our friends who had their 6 month old with them was too cold.  We went to the pool which was a lot colder than previous and the air temperature colder too, Than when we have been before in winter and the locker area an obstacle course to get in due to the prams and buggies. In the shops all the card machines were down and some places you only could pay by cash. When we have been before we got vouchers to spend whilst staying at the Park - this has also stopped. The 2 for 1 meals that used to be at the sports bar have stopped and the 10% loyalty return discount if booked within 28 days has stopped too.On the whole it appears Centre Parcs are reducing standards and pumping up prices and as mentioned by others more lodges and apartments is going to mean more people. Staff were lovely and all we came into contact with couldn't do enough to help. All staff tried to help or sort out issues but all mentioned that standards were dropping.I know we will probably attract the usual guest services email from customer services saying how sorry they are and we are sorry for your bad experience etc but do yourselves a favour. Just sort out the standards and stop the penny pinching while staying at the parcs, start thinking about how to attract our custom back by not pumping prices up even more and think about loyalty ideas again and get back to where you were 5years ago!

groupe_9,"This was our first visit and we had great expectations of a Center Parcs holiday but sadly it was a big disappointment.  The drive through check in seemed great at first but you get very little information on the way things work and what to do, we did however get a brochure of activities, you could spend all day reading this and still be non the wiser of what's best for you and your family.  We travelled with 3 children aged from 2-9 years, non of the activities seems to coincide for the varied ages of our children so even if they hadn't been extortionately priced then it would have been difficult.  So, we decided to hire bikes ( ¬£120+ for 4 days), its the only way to get around as it is a car free zone and gave something for the children to do. We really enjoyed the cycling but once you have cycled the site and beach area once or twice it doesn't leave much else to look at.  The subtropical swimming pool is the best part and possibly the only thing that's doesn't come at an additional cost, it was very busy but if you go early evening it calms down a little.  The no car zone is a good for cyclists and the fact the barrier is down makes it a safe environment for families however it felt restrictive and if you did fancy going off site to explore something other than the site its not possible.For the cost of the accommodation I expected more, it was nice with good fixtures and fittings but nothing special and not quite the woodland lodge we had envisioned, more of a brick bungalow cladded with wood, the log burner - just a flue with a nice sign to the side stating that only fire blocks bought from the site store were to be burnt on it, these logs were ¬£5 each from the Parcmarket and there is little difference between these and the ones for ¬£1 at B&amp;M bargains.  On a more positive note, it was nice to have the local birds at the patio windows regularly, and sometimes a cheeky one inside!  On our last day check out is at 10am, you must return your bikes retrieve your car and then return to your lodge to pack and go, we felt rather pressured doing this as when we were packing up the car at 9.50 the cleaner was sat waiting outside of our lodge on tender hooks to get us out and get in.  Check out was chaos and the car free zone became a car park with everyone eager to get off the site by the 10am deadline!Overall it was a very disappointing break for us which was overpriced and very impersonal, there was lots to do if you could find it and afford it but for us this will be our first and last visit!",1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0
groupe_9,"We decided on Centre Parcs as a last minute booking having only been on a day pass previously. We stayed Monday to Friday in a standard villa with my wife and our 3 children aged 15, 12 &amp; 10. Pros-Loads of activities for everyone, we played badminton, football pool, roller skating and had a 3 person canoe. Unlimited use of the sub tropical paradise (pool) which was busy at certain times, we found after 5/6pm a bit quieter. Loads of wildlife to see and feed. Nice villa, with dish washer, TV's, all kitchen kit, lovely quilts, towels ...everything you need. Food out was nice if a bit pricey, shop is well stocked again a bit pricey. Cons - Few ants in the villa. Only 2 x loo rolls so we had to buy more. Our villa was on outskirts so a long walk to any activities so would have been bad in the rain. Pool really busy at times and people can be rude, same goes for bikes on paths.... some people think they own the place.  Overall we enjoyed our break, all the kids had a good time which is surprising based on ages (15,12 &amp; 10) so we would probably return and get bikes to be those people. Also a lot of activities on top of the included pool but some are over-priced ... ¬£150 plus for 5 of us to do an aerial adventure ... probably last about an hour at most. Good break but costly.

The lodge was beautifully laid out for us all with plenty of towels, extras like dishwasher tablets plus 2 fridges as well as a drinks fridge and a games room that provided entertainment for everyone. Our cleaners looked after the lodge well so we could all switch off from housework. Safe roads for us all to cycle or walk to the wide selection of activities we had booked, was such a good feeling especially for the 3 year olds. Segway was a favourite activity, with our 3 year olds liking jet skis and the older children enjoying the challenge of the climbing wall. We ate at Hucks and Bella Italia. Hucks was the favourite with more for the children to do while the adults ate a very generous meal.By the end of the week the children were planning their next stays activities.",0.0,,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

We have been going to centre parcs at Nottingham every year for 10 years.The food in the sports bar was poor quality, we received a different meal to the one we ordered and then when it arrived it was over cooked. The girl who collected the plates saw that we had left the food and she asked if everything was ok, we said we couldn't eat 2 of the meals because they were over cooked , she replied oh ok. The staff normally wish a child happy birthday throughout their stay as they give them a special birthday badge to wear, on this occasion not once during the 7 day stay did anyone say happy birthday to our child.The place where you hire the mobility scooters has a silly system where you pay a deposit then have to go to another section to get the scooter, on return of the scooter I was told to put it over there, and then was told to walk to the other section of the building to collect the deposit, this is difficult when you actually do require wheels to enable you to get around.i had to wait for my husband to collect my wheelchair from the car so I could transfer from the scooter to my wheelchair as they will not let anyone else take the scooter back or collect the refund. they need a system where the deposit refund and the scooter go back to the same destination.We have always loved going to Sherwood forest but on this occasion it was a big let down, we feel thoroughly disappointed in the poor customer service throughout  our 7 day stay.",1.0,-1.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0
groupe_9,"Obviously Centre Parcs has a great reputation and we were expecting to love it. We were sadly really disappointed with this place which just seems tired and way overpriced. We stayed in a woodland lodge and it was really cramped - hardly any room to move around and you are right on top of the neighbouring lodges. Add to that a hen party next door with people smoking and talking RIGHT outside your window all night and we didn't get much sleep! The lodge was also quite dirty (I overheard 2 other families saying the same). There were blood stains on our duvet, make up stains on the towels and lipstick marks on the wine glasses. There were also the remnants of someone else's toilet activity left in the loo when we arrived! Not exactly 5 star. Swimming was really busy and the changing rooms were chaotic and overcrowded. The central area of restaurants and shops felt a bit like a motorway service station. Also slightly worrying was the fact that we asked guest services for an extra key for our lodge and they simply asked which number and just handed it over. No further information like guest name required! The service in the restaurants was slow, particularly in the pancake house, and the food pretty stodgy and poor. There was a lot of building work going on and so maybe they are upgrading their facilities. The path back to the lodges wasn't well lit at night and I wouldn't have wanted to walk on my own. The off roading kids experience was great, as was the crazy science, but all in all the weekend was expensive and really underwhelming. ¬£4,000 a week for some of the chalets at peak time seems crazy for what you get, which is certainly not a 5 star experience.

groupe_9,"Firstly, I can not fault the villa cleanliness and it had all of the kitchen ware except baking trays but I took my own anyway. The set up was great for our family break.All of the staff across the whole site were great. Have to say a special thanks to cafe rouge for a fantastic late lunch on Friday 30th. Manager was lovely and staff worked really hard. It's sensible to book as it was busy and you can't expect to hassle the staff into finding you a table- like I saw one lady trying to do!!! Great to see the manager supporting his staff and saying no. Kids disco great and the cocktails lovely and all made fresh.Pool is great. Very clean and loads of life guards so everyone is safe. You have to pay for pretty much everything while you are there apart from the pool but it's reasonable for a leisure park. Don't expect meal deals in the restaurants!The only reason I am giving this review a 4 is the entertainment in the villa. Firstly, only 8 channels on the tv in this day and age is poor. I've stayed all over the UK and always had all freebies channels. I took my Firestick and amazon echo neither of which I could connect and the phone line support was in America and there was nothing they could do nothing to help. I was prepared to pay extra but that was not available. Management need to do something about this. Another leisure park more or less across the road manage better tv and movies so centre parcs need to sort this out. There are loads of parents with young children and you need entertainment when they have gone to bed aside from channels 1-6 and sky 1 and sky news plus a couple of kids channels. We took DVDs and thank goodness we did! We were able to connect the wii for the kids.Please upgrade your internet so people can connect their own fire sticks etc or significantly improve your tv service. We paid ¬£800 for 3nights/4 days and I feel I should be able to get decent tv for that price. ",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,0.0,

I could have found fault, the sofa was tired, small rips in the wall paper. Not a deal breaker if you paid an average price but for the price you pay the standard wasn't acceptable.Since our last visit wristbands now open your chalet and double for lockers. Not carrying keys was a nice touch.The site itself was its normal good standard. Activities are expensive. Eye wateringly so. Eating out also not cheap. The parc market also continues to take from your wallet. And that pretty much sums it up. Centre Parcs has become a heaven for those prepared to pay far too much for mediocre facilities. Don't get me wrong. The holiday won't disappoint but unless you are cramming in multiple adult families into a lodge , the price for families simply doesn't add up. As an example we have booked a holiday All inclusive in Turkey for less per person per night for the same time at Centre Parcs.In summary the price a family pay per night with activities, you will get a much better holiday elsewhere.

All the beds were very comfortable and rooms were very well appointed with good views and balconies to some. The cleaners came in once a day and did a very good job although we were pretty tidy anyway. Out weather was very poor rain all day on the Saturday and snow and sleet on the Sunday so very restricting to outdoor activities. This made the swimming area and indoor activities very busy with queues for the rapids and slides.  The supermarket was very well stocked and the restaurants / cafes were very clean with Ok prices.  We had to small children within the party and perhaps they were too young, 4+ would be the ideal age to get the most from the experience.  All the staff we encountered were very friendly and knowledgeable and in general the organisation was very slick. The criticisms we had were the signage could have been a lot better around the park, having to leave by 10am and the wesite relating to act ivies was quite poor, all is needed is a list of what is available and enter from there, you seem to have to go round houses to find anything.

groupe_9,"GENERAL:Have been twice before (first time in March 2017, second in August 2017) and have just booked to go back this May. Both previous trips did not disappoint, and in fact have left us waiting to book the third trip we just paid for. We can't wait.Total tranquility, peace and relaxation from start to finish...with moments of exhilaration, pampering and exercise thrown in at your leisure. It really is a place to tailor a break just to you and who you're with. COST:Lots of people say the trips are pricey, and they are - BUT, the pool, parc and lodges are kept beautifully clean and in really good condition, and there is SO much to do that is free and you can bring all your own food (Sainsburys just up the main road) and prepare your own food as you would at home/self catering. Centre Parcs doesn't make you pay for anything but getting there/your stay. If you're planning a budgeted trip without extra costs there is so much to do: walks, swimming, play areas, lake walks, bring your bikes, board games, DVDs, music, bring your own face masks/nail bits etc. and really enjoy the patio/BBQ, nature watching and strolling to the main village to browse. We certainly don't go 'all in' for the additional activities, and having so much choice is what makes the park never feel too crowded...even when we were there last August.Activities with additional costs would make for a near endless list: treetop adventures, crazy golf, spa, horse and carriage rides, mini golf, boats, segways, bowling, owl experience, badminton, wall climbing etc. and I don't think we could go back 10 times and mange to or want to do them all. That's what makes it ideal for all.LENGTH OF STAY:1 of our trips was for a week and 1 for the long weekend and both felt as if they lasted a really long time and left us totally refreshed like a week away. As soon as we arrive we relax and feel a total 'switch-off' and it feels like you could be anywhere. ACCOMODATION:Both previous visits and the one we just booked are for the plain/basic lodges and they are really nice. No complaints at all and spotlessly clean and kitted out for all of our sleeping/resting/cooking needs. Glorious large patio doors/windows to all bedrooms provide perfect nature watching (don't think the tv went on during either of our stays even though we took a few of the kiddo DVDs!) and we saw rabbits, ducks, deer, squirrels and more squirrels. Patio areas are nice and private too, which is thanks to the careful layout as in reality you are really close to neighbouring lodges. OVERALL:We know CParcs isn't the cheapest break when you look at price per day, but because we can plan in a full 4 day (3 night) or 5 day (4 night) break and feel just as refreshed and relaxed as a week away it does mean we can do this for less.

groupe_9,"First experience of Center Parcs. We liked our 2 bed chalet, very clean which is always my priority. Decent size and well equipped. From the outside not overly attractive, lodges are much nicer (¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£) I like the ideas of cars being returned to general car park but as always there were a few who didn't comply. (Not applicable to disabled obviously) In the summer months I expect it's near impossible to enjoy your patio area in peace as everyone is out BBQ-ing/playing music etc pretty much next to each other. The pool has some good slides although I was quite surprised how small is actually was, I don't know how it deals with the summer crowds. Jacuzzi tubs are getting a bit grotty. The lagoon 'relaxing' pool was just full of kids. Kid section looked good.Didn't find the onsite shop expensive as expected but the restaurants are. I thought the food at Hucks was ok but service slow. Although people coming in after us getting served quicker so probably just pot luck.Considering it's an activity holiday I was surprised and actually disappointed at the set up. I.e. The indoors activities quite on top of each other, I thought there would be much more purpose built separate areas for the activities. It felt like they'd just fit in as many things into one space as possible. One of my biggest bugs was the bowling.... shoes are kept in cubby holes at the end of the lanes... once used they are just put back for the next person to put straight on!! No deodorising/ anti bac spray at all! We all kept our own shoes on but we heard other people making comments about the shoes feeling hot &amp; sweaty from the person before GROSS!!It's a great idea for what it is but they either need to improve the activities and areas or make them more affordable. Apart from the pool and if you take your own bikes EVERYTHING else is extra. Not even 1 hour activity of your choice like table tennis or squash included in the price of what potentially is an extortionate cost for accommodation only. We also found the turfing out at 10am a mood kill after enjoyable week break. Retrieving the car from the car park then joining a huge queue around the park to get back to your lodge to load up was a bit longer than expected but necessary to have vehicle free haven for your stay. In general we enjoyed our stay as it was peaceful off peak and we made our own fun, what we did pay out was worth it as we balanced it up with saving money elsewhere. We are a bit more clued up as to what to expect next time and where money could be saved. Off peak and split between a group of friends the cost is feasible but I would hate to experience this in school holidays as I expect it's absolutely heaving and everyone on top of each other in the activity center/communal areas in general.",0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,0.0,

groupe_9,"This was our first visit to Sherwood having always previously visited Whinfell. Sherwood felt like a different experience - and didn't seem to offer the same tranquility as Whinfell. The main pool area at Sherwood seemed to be very very full and was a challenging experience and was very very noisy - but this is from an adults perspective - I think the kids loved it to bits.  The outdoor woodland areas didn't seem to be as enchanting as Whinfell. The aqua sana is very different to Whinfell - but not in a bad way - Sherwood offers some quite quirky features - like outdoor hot tubs and a treehouse sauna - so this was different and enjoyable. Some of the relaxation rooms were quirky and has a very different theme to Whinfell - whereas Whinfell does simply just offer different variations of steam rooms and a fairly mainstream, albeit large sauna.  The outdoor pool at Sherwood aqua sana is enjoyable - but it doesn't offer the picturesque skyline of pine trees like Whinfell. The lodges at Sherwood we're great - we stayed in a dog lodge and this was clean, modern and well equipped - although the location of this was at the boundary edge of the resort - but still easily accessible to main areas. The car park at Sherwood was a bit of a nightmare - spaces were tight and tension was high due to endless circling - the car park attendant eventually just allowed us to park at our lodge early so that we could try again later - this was a bonus as we managed to get into the lodge earlier too - which is somewhat unheard of at Center Parc unless you pay extra.  Ultimately we won't be going back to Sherwood - but I think this is just due to personal preference and logistically for us it's a much more pleasant journey up to the Lake District to Whinfell.

The lodge was a little dated and wasn't too my standard of cleaning, we did have daily housekeeping, however, this was very basic I don't think the floors were cleaned in the week we stayed.  There was an issue with a broken electrical socket and this was attended to and fixed within an hour.  There was lovely walks around Centre Parcs we took our son's bike with us.  We done the messy pups activity which was good fun and also the baby owls we very much enjoyed this.  We went to Starbucks for coffee and this was very reasonable, we ordered an indian takeaway one night this was just ok and we went to the Italian which was very expensive.

groupe_9,"We went away for our first family holiday since our daughter was born 4 months ago. Despite the bad weather, we had a fab time. We phoned ahead to ensure there was a cot in the room for our 4m old and it was there on arrival. The lodge we had was very small (a one bedroom studio lodge) and with her being so young and the living space having either a window, radiator, or cooker on each wall, the safest place for her cot to be was next to the bed but this was a very tight squeeze. None the less, the cot was clean and safe and she slept fine in it! We had activities booked before going, using the app, which was great so we had a plan for the day (very useful with a baby). We did Segways, archery, arial adventure, had a massage, baby sensory for under 2y olds, and booked our baby into the creche for 3 hours on 2 days. The activities were all great. The staff running them were kind and patient as we learned what we were doing, and seemed to enjoy what they were doing.  As a 1st time mum of a 4 month old baby, I was very apprehensive leaving her in the creche for 3 hours and expected to be called to collect her early. That wasn't the case and she loved it there. The staff were incredible and I was so happy with the service I had no problems leaving her in there on the second day. They clearly love their jobs there and take great care of the babies. We received a report card with all the details of her 3 hour stay, and a nice little painting they did with her too to take home. Lovely little touches. A huge thank you to the creche staff working Easter weekend!We had dinner at Hucks restaurant which was lovely, reasonably priced, and the staff were friendly and helpful. We also ate at the Foresters inn but weren't as keen. The food was not as good and he service was a little slower. We also didn't realise it was right at the back of the park when booking so took us around 25 minutes to walk there. Not the parcs fault, just a comment on our evening. All in all it was a nice little getaway. A little pricy (¬£495 for the 3 nights) considering the size and quality of the room, but we did chose the cheapest option. When you add activities and food, the price adds up. Best Bits: the creche and their staff, the ease of booking activities and then the activities themselves, the parc layout... easy to navigate on foot and all the best bits are nearby to eachother.The downsides: the lodge was quite small and unimpressive. Quite pricy... the lodge itself was a bit expensive for what you get, he massages were almost ¬£50 for 25 minutes, and other activities were on the steep side too.

Accommodation is 3 bed woodland lodge.First time here and had no idea what to expect.We are underwhelmed and feeling a bit ripped off in that typically British way..It's ALRIGHT.We are here totally out of season so having paid ¬£299 for a 4 night stay, I can't say the quality of the lodge for that price isn't good value for money. It's got everything you need and it's clean enough and it's comfortable.The biggest asset of the accommodation is the log burner but that does loose its novelty when you start literally burning your money on it (over ¬£4 for a silly little eco log that lasts 2 hours)The view out from the lodge does give the illusion of seclusion until you walk a foot past the patio and realise everyone else on the blocks outside space is metres away from each other.I imagine when the weather is nice and everyone is using the gardens then there wouldn't be any private or quiet outside space at all.Everything on site is very expensive.Food outlets mimic service station type prices. The activities sound great but are too over priced for a family to enjoy together. A 15 minute pony ride for two of my children would cost us ¬£37.I can get a full on 45 minute horse riding lesson for both of them for that price at home (a mere 30 minutes down the road)I came with money to spend and am not generally very thrifty, but I've just found myself genuinely peeved at being blatantly taken advantage of with the price of things.Due to this we all agreed to keep as much money as we can firmly in our pockets and enjoy a few decent nights out when we are home.If you pay ¬£300 or less, eat self catering with food bought out of the site and bring lots of your own entertainment and bloody fire logs! You could call it value for money.The swimming is free and is warm and pretty decent.If I had come here in peak season and paid the MENTAL prices they were asking I would be super angry. It's a shame because I want to love it and would have loved to find a proper wonderful uk based holiday that lived up to the hype that I would have splashed out on at peak season.This isn't it. If you like the idea of running off to the woods in a very mainstream manner then hell - the WiFi works and Starbucks is on every corner. Maybe this is for you.I think I'll stick to finding the quirky 'real deal' air'BnB gems in the future though.

Centre Parcs have commented in other reviews that numbers of guests using the pool is monitored to ensure no over crowding but we saw no evidence that they were counting, there certainly wasn't anyone at the entrance and the pool did feel crowded, Rapids very busy and long waits for cyclone and changing rooms full.

Our first night we were woken at around 3am by the fire alarm in our lodge, on investigation we could smell smoke on the upstairs landing and on further investigation we discovered that there was a leak in the airing cupboard which had dripped onto the electrics causing smoke etc. I immediately called customer services, the security guys were with us within minutes!! (i never got their names but they really did prove their worth that evening, thank you so much!) they called an engineer who talked them through shutting it down to make it safe. We chose to stay in our lodge for the rest of the night as we had two children and two babys asleep and there were no more four bedroom lodges available. We had no heating but were assured we would have an engineer to fix it by 8am which we did, the security guys also brought us some logs for the fire. We were also left without water to use but again after speaking to customer services we were brought some bottled water. So after a very eventful and unappealing start we had a fantastic stay, everywhere was clean and fresh and whilst the shops and restaurants are expensive, it is definitely possible to not use any of those.

We did 3 activities they were mini captains adventure we thought this was brilliant value for money and our youngest loved it. The middle child did woodland wheelers and throughly enjoyed it altho i felt the course could of done with some bumps and lumps just to challenge them a bit more. The oldest child and I did aerial adventure which did not dissapoint it was cold the day we did it but we didnt let that put us off so worth getting wrapped up to do that one. The swimming pool was warm everyday we visited my only complaint is the changing rooms which are cold and a nightmare to find an empty one. Im also battered and bruised after going down the rapids constantly for 5 days with the oldest child haha. We where impressed with the lack of traffic around the parc compared to previous times we have been altho there seemed to be alot of cars parked up on the roads near the lodges. Parc market is resonably priced and probably no more expensive than our local shop. The treats shop was a hit with the kidsWe ate at dexters, pancake house and hucks i was very impressed with seperate dairy free menus this makes eating out very stress free as our youngest is dairy free. but some more training in the pancake house on the difference between dairy free and lactose free would be helpful as they seemed unsure. My only complaint about our time there is the sheer number of new lodges that have been built but no more parking or changing facilities. We want to return in summer but looking at the prices this may well of been our last centre parcs holiday :(All of the staff around the parc where friendly and always smiling and 3 staff members who really stood out where the lady who was on aeriel adventure with the blonde hair who put my oldest at ease at the top of the zip wire when it was wobbling and he was getting a bit worried, the blonde lady in aquatique on wednesday afternoon who had brilliant customer service and last but not least the gent who was running the woodland wheelers on tuesday afternoon our child made sure he earned his money for that session i really hope his heart rate came down after chasing our child around on a runaway segway.

So relaxing, such a beautiful experience staying in the forest. Perfect family holiday. Of course everything is expensive so don't expect a cheap get away. The only disappointment was some of the miserable staff members! I think they may need a bit of training. If your looking for a review perhaps stop reading as I'm using the next section to discuss some of the staff members. We notified the lifeguards of a large stool in the pool and they ignored us. We told them half an hour later and they asked me partner to get in the pool and  show them where it was. It stank and was very un hygienic. They still didn't clean it away. A lady who serves food at the food bar in the subtropical paradise was miserable as anything. Very very moody. Didn't say hello or thank you. Or even crack a smile. Not what you expect when you pay a fortune to come on holiday here! A few other staff members were also incredibly rude and miserable. Some of the staff members I noticed worked extra hard to be polite and kind to the customers. And I think it's only right to mention them. Margaret Who works at the parc market, she was smiley, so lovely, friendly and polite! And Donna and Louise who work at Starbucks Who were both really friendly. The lovely gentleman at the top of the zip wire. He was very good at his job and so friendly. And David the groundsman I think he was called, he was wonderful. And Charlotte one of the workers in the subtropical swimming paradise. She was at the top of the grand cascade. She was very smiley and enthusiastic. Not what I usually get greeted with at the top of that slide. It's usually glum miserable looking staff members who look like they hate there job.

We have been visiting Sherwood for the last 20 years and are never disappointed. There is always plenty of activities to choose for any age and ability and you can make it as cheap or as expensive to suit you. We usually only eat out once to keep the cost down and the rest of the time it's grest to prepare food together and have family fun at the lodge.Places we visited this time: Hucks for Saturday night dinner where we ate good American style food. Service was a little slow but it was peak time and it didn't bother us as we enjoyed our drinks.Subtropical paradise every day, the Grand cascade ride and rapids being the main attraction. Changing rooms can get busy as there are many families with small children to cater for. We just searched for free cubicles and always found one within 10 mins.Parcmarket shopping was just for fire logs and basics. Again to keep the cost down we took food and drinks with us for most of the weekend. To do a full shop here would be costly as prices aren't regular Tesco prices! Leisure bowl for bowling. There was 7 of us on one lane and it was a great experience. 1 hours bowling at a cost of about ¬£4 each- not a bad hours entertainment. Plenty of shoes to go round. Sports pavilion was very busy on our visit to play badminton. Just a short wait to check in and staff were really helpful, giving directions to the court and giving equipment. Again, as a collective activity the cost worked out less than about ¬£6 each. We hired an electric boat for 6 for 30 minutes on the lake at a cost of ¬£23. Staff helpful and clear in their instructions- a fun time especially being able to see the wildlife in the shore, see the new zip wire, and chill in the sunshine we got.Had a hot chocolate at Foresters with all the trimmings- marshmallow, cream, flake and sat outside. There has been the addition of new family activities there; the maze and putting which are within site of the outdoor seating area- just right for watching the kids from s distance. All in all this is a fantastic experience for families.

Our lodge was situated in close proximity to this and whilst we were only partially effected by the sight of the fence and the mess if we had not been on the end we were I think we would have been quite peeved as that is all you would have seen from your window, if you are booked in 96,97 or 98 see if you can move, particularly midweek as you will get the noise and mess too.In particular I thought the plastic wrappings from the builders materials strewn in the trees was as far from CP's &quot;clean cut&quot; image as you can get!!! Rather disappointingly Center Parcs never made reference to these extensive works at time of booking even when we paid extra to select location - a bit naughty that!They'll say that the work will enhance the guests experience but it certainly wont if you are there anytime until its finished.We also had an issue with water pressure in our lodge, having opted for an Executive one we would have assumed that you could run more than one tap at the same time (particularly as it had 2 bathrooms), sadly not.  If any tap, shower or even the dishwasher was in operation you couldn't use another tap without the pressure dropping to almost a trickle.

It nearly didn't however as we had originally booked to go the first weekend in March when the country experience the horrendous snowy conditions. We were snowed in at home and couldn't get there safely but Centre Parcs were brilliant and offered for us to switch our holiday dates without question or cost. I spoke with 2 CP representatives who were both very efficient and helpful in this matter taking away any stress from the situation.All the staff we came into contact with on site were all very friendly and welcoming from the moment we arrived at on site and making an extra effort to interact with the children also.We all had a thoroughly wonderful break (the dry weather obviously also helped!)

On arrival we were checked in in no time at all, before parking up and going to explore.The layout is different from what i remembered (due to the fire I guess) however, it was still fantastic. Different from longleat where the majority is located within the dome, this is more of a village layout. I didn't know what to make of it first, but soon got use to it.Our lodge, 332, was extremely well presented, and immaculately clean. We had a small issue with not being able to get into the safe (last occupiers had left it locked) but tech  services soon put this right for us.Once unpacked we headed straight to the pool, which again is different from what I remember, but at no detriment. The kids play pool is fantastic, and our two little'ens would have spend all day every day there if they could.First night we decided to dine in, the takeaway service arrived right at the beginning of the half hour time slot, food was piping hot and delicious.Next day it was more pool, a pony ride for my daughter (which was great value for money and made her holiday) and an evening meal at the excellent Huck's.Day three, pool closed due to unforeseen circumstances, so we went bowling instead. Had just as good a time doing this to be honest. Then on to Bella Italia, awesome in a word! My wife wasn't looking forward to this as she doesn't like much Italian food however, she admits now that it was the best restaurant and food of the whole stay!Thursday we did pots with tots, which was fantastic too. Pancakes for lunch, yum. Huck's again in the evening.

groupe_10,"Firstly we did have a good holiday and the staff were all helpful, friendly and quick to respond when called on. We were staying in a 4/5 bed disabled villa with hot tub, sauna and steam rooms. We had 6 adults ( 1 disabled wheelchair user and 2 with serious health issues) and 2 kids ( 10 &amp; 7) All the restaurant, shop and cleaning staff were helpful and friendly so no complaints there. The pottery painting was great as always. Other activities members of our group tried were all great fun and worthwhile. The kids loved the pool area and had a great time. Seeing the wildlife come to your door is so nice. So now the not so great bits! We had several problems in our villa -1) heating - upstairs was super hot but the disabled extension was cold - they brought in extra heaters and reset thermostats. Very quick to respond and kept dropping by to check. 2) shower - the shower heat came lose on my shower and I flooded the bathroom LOL! They came straight round and tightened it up and we had a laugh while mopping up.3) noisy neighbours - everyone wants to have a good time on holiday but next door got louder after 11pm, we had 2 kids with us and 3 with health issues so needed rest. Security came straight over and just reminded them that they needed to quieten down and they did. However the next night we again had to call security as they were singing and screaming at 2 am! After this we didn't have any further problems. 4) The villa could do with some TLC, getting slightly tatty in places and not what I would expect for one of the biggest villas. 5) there were a few other minor things that we sorted out. There was building work going on during our stay but can honestly say that it didn't affect our holiday at all! The noise was kept to a minimum ( didn't hear any). However just remember that you are not far from a couple of American airbases and they have jets flying over at some point most days. We spoke to the customer services team and they were very helpful and offered us some compensation for the problems we had, they were grateful that we spoke to them in a calm manner and allowed them to sort out the problems where possible.

groupe_10,"The whole family - grandparents; children; grandchildren - have been enjoying Christmas at Center Parcs Elveden Forest for the last seven years. I think that is recommendation enough to convey what a positive experience it is for young and old.  It is run expertly and efficiently with the guest in mind at all times. All facilities are clean and well maintained and any issue is dealt with immediately. Every activity whether indoor or outdoor is available for young and old.  It is wonderful to be able to discard the car and enjoy cycling or walking everywhere on car-free roads in fresh forest surroundings. If you go during any school holiday break, be sure to book both your activities and, if you are not self-catering, your restaurants of which there are many to choose.  The Center Parc APP is also very convenient for all members of the party to read your Itinerary of the day and book or amend reservations.If you want to be within walking distance of the incredibly well stocked supermarket, the Swimming Tropical Paradise and the Sports Centre, request a Lodge near the Centre.  You can also pay extra for 'early check in' which allows you early entry into your Lodge on your arrival day.  As grandparents, we leave each year wondering if the children will want to return for another year and the question is ALWAYS answered by a resounding YES which ensures we take advantage of the 'come-back-soon' discount.

We paid just under ¬£1500 for a midweek break at the beginning of January. We started noticing issues in the Lodge straight away;The blind in the games room was broken, it wouldn't pull down and some of the slats were snapped. The remote controllers for both TV's downstairs were missing, and the bottle shelf in one of the fridges was hanging off and fell out when you opened the fridge. All these issues were reported to Guest Services who sent an engineer out with replacement remote controllers but said that he wouldn't be able to fix the blind and that we were to just keep it lowered. He also wouldn't be able to do anything with the fridge and that we should just use the shelf on the other one.During the course of our week we also noticed other problems with the Lodge. The Dishwasher didn't work, we would have to wash by hand anything that was put in the dishwasher as it often came out dirtier then when it went in, and the Velux windows in one of the bathrooms was broken with the handle being snapped off.All in all we were very disappointed with the exclusive lodge, It felt like it needed badly renovating. The stair case in particular was so creaky that it would wake anyone in the downstairs bedroom if anyone had to use it during the night, maybe replacing the very worn carpet would solve this.This hasn't stopped me wanting to come back to center Parcs as the rest of the Village as usual was perfect. As always customer service is amazing.On a foot note, If you like the sounds of Fighter Jets flying then you'll love Elveden Forest..

Rajinder Pradesh being a good example - ¬£14 for a main course with very small portion and then on top ¬£4 for rice and ¬£4 for Nan and even the poppadoms are charged for.

groupe_10,"Just got back from a 4 night break. The weather was kind to us again which was nice. Let's get the negatives out of the way first. We stayed in a u201cNEWu201d executive 2 bedroom lodge 392 Birch. I don't think these are new, just painted and spruced up as we stayed a few lodges down before a remember these u201cnewu201d lodges being there. The plinth under the fridges wasn't fixed to anything and kept falling over, fridge door didn't shut properly every time, the heating kept shutting down and not working (had two engineers out) the grout in the shower room was falling out, fair few movement cracks around the whole lodge. The hydro bath on the main bedroom had a mind of its own. This kept turning on throughout the day and night!!! In the night it's the most horrific thing to be woken up by. You get less than the normal free view channels on the Tv's (not that we were there to watch tv) and the TVs in the bedrooms were black and white! It's 2018 not 1944. I really couldn't be bothered to ring and chase guest services about a black and white tv! The park itself is the same as it's was a few years back. Most areas and restaurants need to be made bigger. You have added more lodges and houses, yet you haven't accommodated for the extra people. Swimming was fun but again, we went in school time so it wasn't at full capacity and could actually get on the slides etc. Can't imagine how anyone gets changed or actually gets a seating area for their family at full capacity. The changing areas need sorting out. They are freezing cold and always rammed. The prices of activities are becoming an absolute joke also. You are beginning to price out the average earning family. Over ¬£20 for a 10 min mini jet ski experience. Daylight robbery!!The rest of the place wasn't too bad. Food prices are a bit high but as expected.

groupe_10,"Just got back from a 4 night break with my partner and dog. We have been before without our dog bit according to CP webpage they consider dogs as family so we thought we would take ours with the intention of a long walk with him in the morning then go for a swim or activity then a meal followed by an evening walk with the dog. We arrived to find the doors can now be opened from outside with a wristband which is programmed to each lodge but on unloading the car and putting our dog safely in the lodge what we didn't realise is to open the door you just push down the handle as there is no other lock and this is exactly what our dog did. We spoke to guest service who sent maintenance who suggested he shortened the security chain on the inside and we exit via the patio doors leaving our lodge unlocked! Guest services were spoken to 3 times and although confirmed that this was an issue which had happened before could not offer a solution despite me asking for a key lock to secure the door. We therefore could not use any of the facilities as we had to remain with the dog, we even had to change our massage to separate times which took the magic from that experience, we could not go for the meal we had planned for my partners birthday either . Further to this the dog exercise area is a small pen which is the only place the dog can be off a lead despite being in 100 acres of forest, dogs are not welcome to sit outside the cafes or restaurant while you have a drink. So centre Parcs if your idea of including a family member is leaving them looked up in a lodge and only allowed to roam in a 20x20ft pen you have got the mark. Also parents of young children also beware of my dog can open the door so can your child!I am going to speak to CP head office, I have already tried Facebook and all they suggested was speak to guest services at Elveden even when I said I had already done this they kept on repeating the same comment.

Everything is so over priced, we had a takeaway on the Saturday evening, it wasn't the best and part of our order was missing.

Only criticism for me is the value for money. We knew another family on site at the same time who had a 2 bed standard lodge and compared to ours which was a one bed executive lodge and more expensive, their bedrooms and kitchen area were allot more spacious and allot more value for money. I understand that you get added extras when paying for executive I was just slightly disappointed.

groupe_10,"We normally visit centre parcs every year as a family of 10 for the past 6 years, however after this year we won't be returning. When we first arrived at the lodge you could tell that it hadn't been cleaned properly, the bath was still dirty and they hadn't hoovered, as when you moved the coffee table in the lounge area there was mud, Due to the fact it was a dog lodge we wasn't expecting to be able to eat are food off the floor, but I didn't release it was hard to hoover the floor. We did this ourselves as we had a dog with us and didn't want cleaners coming back to the lodge while we were out. While staying at the lodge we noticed a few this such as a number of doors in the lodge had to be slammed shut as you couldn't shut them any other way, which concerned us, due to the fact if the front door didn't shut correctly the dog could of gotten out. Centre parcs need to stress the rules of bringing a dog on site, as there was more than one occasion we saw dogs off leads when they were not meant to be chasing squirrels and the the owners doing nothing about it. This there number one rule and several visitors didn't seem to care. This was the first year we had been to centre parcs as vegans and were very disappointed with the range of food you could get from the parcmarket while there, literally two things a tub of ice cream and pringles, which were extremely over priced. As I have said before we have been to centre parcs several times, however this time we only went out for one meal due to the fact that prices have been put up stupidly high, ¬£4 for a single j2o. We have never had to go off site before to get food. I would highly recommend going to the Sainsbury's in thetford which is 5 minutes down the road before going to centre parcs, don't buy from the shop. The variety of vegan food with each restaurant isn't great either they currently only have 3 or 4 options to choose from and you could easy make it at the lodge or home cheaper. This is one area they need to improve on. If I was however going to recommend and restaurant it would have to be the pancake house, they have several options of pancakes to chose from and the staff there are brilliant.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0

On arrival there was a bit of car-queuing as we went through the checkpoint but it wasn't too bad.  We arrived around 1.30pm so parked up and had a walk around the main central area.  Headed back to the car at 3pm (like hundreds of others) to drive to our lodge which was not too far from the car park.  Again there is a bit of queuing and kerfuffle which in hindsight I think could be better managed (a la Disney car parks which are super-efficient).I had paid a little extra to choose which lodge in advance.  I don't know how much benefit this has and what the allocation might have been like had we not pre-chosen but we were happy with the location.  We had an executive lodge with a main living and living/kitchen/dining area, a nice little patio and BBQ although we didn't use it and a view over the lake.  The property had 2 bedrooms - the double being large and 2 bathrooms plus another WC - all very clean and well maintained.The site was still decorated with the Christmas tree and loads of fairy lights everywhere which gave it a really magical feeling.The first night we cooked and then went to do the Family Quiz in the Sports Bar which was good fun.  Over the rest of the stay we did badminton, table-tennis, indoor climbing, fencing, loads of pool, swimming, mini golf and pottery painting.  None of it is cheap although the climbing and the fencing I felt were good value for money.  The swimming pool with the wave machine and various slides etc is good and the rapids were hilarious for a 40 something year old splashing and barging into others.  We even tried the outdoor pool and plunge pool - but only very briefly - brrrr!!We ate out at the Pancakes House (best salmon and cream cheese pancake, truly one of the top 10 things I've ever eaten), Huck's American bar and diner and the Forresters Inn.  The food in each was good and the service was excellence I couldn't fault it.We didn't hire or take cycles and enjoyed walking around the site but I think if we went back in warmer months we would cycle around.It quickly becomes an expensive trip as nothing is included except for the swimming - we were aware of that but even so it's either budget and book in advance or be prepared to empty your wallet.  We pre-booked most of the activities and it was good that we did as things like badminton were very popular and time slots became difficult to get.We had a really good time and only did a fraction of the activities on offer.

However, the spare twin room that was not used was very small compared the other twin and double room, but as an initial base it suited us great. The rooms were clean and modern, which included an open dinner/kitchen area with a bathroom adjacent. A spare toilet was also available in the hallway area. On arrival, we swiftly checked in and unpacked. On day one, we found a few ants that were around the dining table, but after contacting guest services they were quick to rectify the issue with no complaints. We also required some new batteries for our tv remote which was sorted quickly also. The lodge was great for our requirements with no other faults found.The Subtropical Swimming Paradise was fantastic, which included 3 slides, the dingy ride, the lazy river, the main and outside pool and the water rapids. There was also 4 hot tub areas and an amazing children's swimming complex. These were great rides and did not take long to queue whatsoever, although at times the rapids can get busy but if you time it right, you can miss the bulk of people. My only one criticism would be the lazy river and hot tub areas do need a bit of TLC just to make them more appealing, but that is being very critical! In the busy period, I'd highly recommend hiring a cabana.The plaza and cafe sports area were also great, they offered a wide range of sporting activities from badminton, squash, pool, table tennis, bouldering wall, etc. On our stay, we didn't use these as we were busy with other things, but in my opinion, some activities seemed quite expensive. The same with the Parc Market, the price for some items were ridiculous but I understand if things are being delivered to the facility they are needing to increase the costs, but some were just scandalous (always bring food with you on your travels). By lowering the prices slightly for activities and food, I think it would encourage more use.We have been coming to Center Parcs for well over 10 years now and we continue to return, so they must being doing something right!

The cupboards inside have very obvious wear and tear, there was hardly any storage space, there were filthy finger prints all over the windows, the fridge was dirty and had dirt in the grooves of the fridge seals, the bin had tomato ketchup stains from previous guests, there was something brown dolloped on the radiator (Dread to think what that was), coffee and mud stains on the table, and a huge dead tree slumped infront of our patio. We just could not believe how it had been left and supposedly 'cleaned' before our arrival after arriving early and awaiting to check in to a 'clean' accommodation. Our spa bath also failed towork which was too little too late by the time I was sat in the bath &amp; amember of staff were going to come and help solve the issue, which was appreciated but too late by the time we had realised and spent 30 minutes trying to find the 'spa bath' switch that was hidden deep in one of the cleaning cupboards.The parc is looking very tired, Even some of the light heads were hanging off the street lamps as wewere having a stroll around. The swimming poolwas fun but the water was very cold inside, and again not very clean either. Jane at guest services reported our problems and she was efficient, providing a small bottle of prosecco and chocolates for the inconvience which was much appreciated but to be honest this doesnt really cut it as our relaxing birthday weekend as a couple was ruined due to the issues we experienced. Very overpriced and poor quality for what you pay. Overall we enjoyed our stay but most likely due to the company and not the facilities. Sadly this will be our last visit to Sherwood due to these reasons.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0
groupe_10,"I used this title because I had previously searched for the answer to that very question!! And the answer is yes they did provide it and it was topped up by housekeeping if you had clean. We only used the service twice during our stay and they did an excellent friendly service. We had a 3 bed lodge with a sauna.it was lovely for5 adults and 2 toddlers. Kitchen was great for preparing meals, we only ate out once so I took everything with me for the pre planned meals. Supermarket on site is big,but pricey and of course you have to carry shopping back to the lodge so go prepared. We took our gas bbq and cooked breakfast on the patio and had a steak tea so we used it for that too. Plenty of pans for cooking and adequate utensils. We cycled which was fun but we did find it busy with pedestrians and vehicles which was annoying.there's building work going on so lots of contractors about. Pool was fabulous for our two year old, plenty of slides he could go on with dad.buoyancy vests were provided which was a nice touch.

groupe_10,"Center Parcs is what it is - its good for the kids, its expensive to go and expensive when you get there but if you except all that - its ok. We paid for a chalet near the dome and it was worth every penny for that upgrade. So close to the center that we didn't even bother to hire bikes (we did have young children in the party also). The accommodation is basic, but does the trick. We had an issue with our heating but once it was reported it was dealt with very quickly. The water pressure is terrible, given what you pay to go to center parcs the woodland lodges are far from luxurious - but they are ok. What is lovely is the amount of wildlife around, the children loved spotting swans, ducks, rabbits and squirrels. I will add we went when there was snow and the weather was rubbish, none of that mattered as we spent our days swimming and having loads of fun in the dome. Some areas are a little tired, as some other reviews mention and the changing rooms and some of the pools could do with being a little warmer. On the whole though our children thoroughly enjoyed the swimming complex and what it had to offer, we made some lovely memories and that is what it is all about at the end of the day. Some periods in the dome are busy, but it soon clears when people leave for lunch.afternoon activities. We found the best time to visit in terms of when it was at its quietest was on friday evening and sunday evening.  We ate out at Hucks, we all enjoyed our meals, it was well designed for the children and the service was very good. We went bowling on an afternoon and that was fun and hassle free. The biggest downside was sunday lunch at cafe rouge, we had an extremely long wait for food (1hr and 15 minutes despite booking a table in advance), when the food arrived it was of poor quality and extremely disappointing, the staff were extremely stressed and pushed, it was not enjoyable - however on the plus side the management took our complaint seriously and appeased the situation somewhat. Not sure I would return to Cafe Rouge in a hurry but none the less they did deal with the issues of that afternoon and hopefully they will be more prepared for future guests.Center Parcs for me is a childrens paradise and all of our children enjoyed it and all want to go back again. It would be nice if it was slightly more affordable, but it is what it is and left my kids with huge smiles on their faces - which makes me happy. I would return in the future but might try a different location to mix things up a little.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
groupe_10,"Rightly or wrongly, we compared our stay to our many trips up to the Whinfell Parc, in Cumbria. We had never had a bad holiday there, so we thought we would try it's sister parc, Sherwood.Let's start where it all began - the lodge! We booked 1yr in advance and carefully selected our lodge, which was central in the complex. Only a few weeks before our stay, we were notified that our lodge had been moved to one at the far side of the parc? 1 year in advance and we were still moved!!! Not good. The lodge, as mentioned, was on the far side, well away from where we had chosen. We picked the 'Executive' lodge, with a games room. 'Executive'? Hmmmmm. Let's just say it was in well need of a makeover. Rips in the fancy wallpaper, holes in the walls where the baby gate had been moved, scratches in the paintwork, different coloured doors in the kitchen, sealant in the showers dirty (see pics)........certainly not what we were used to at Whinfell and certainly not the finish I would've expected for the 'Executive' lodge. Our friend had to clan the fridge in our arrival - it was disgusting! The pool.....WOW, the coldest changing rooms in the world. Yes, we were experiencing the coldest temperatures I can ever remember but, the automatic doors on entering the area were wide open and not closing!! The first few changing areas were the family ones, with baby changing stations. I could actually see my breath, it was so cold!! This went on for the most of our stay. This impacted on the whole swimming area. On the whole, we were very disappointed to the whole Parcs appearance and quality - it was just the finer details that doesn't meet up to the high standards of Whinfell. I'm not sure if we dropped on a lodge which was due an update? On the plus side, the cleaners were so helpful, polite and chatty (we let the fridge slip because of this) The pool area is fun, albeit cold. The efforts of the staff to keep the roads and paths clear of snow and ice was a brilliant achievement. Our pool table took some hammer, so would recommend that! Closing advice - go to Whinfell, the whole parc is in beautiful condition and ooozes quality. ",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0

It's getting busier and busier at Elvenden, more units being built, more people staying but everyone uses the same old facilities. On the handover day of Friday we couldn't go down the rapids in the pool it was so busy it was dangerous. We ate out 3 times and at each restaurant there were problems with the bills, twice we were overcharged, thirdly we were asked to pay a cash tip instead of card, but the waitress tried to put the full amount through (with preloaded tip) on my card too. Not sure if it was a mistake but it really annoyed me after she'd specifically asked us to pay a cash tip, which itself is a bit out of order I feel.Next the chalet, was good apart from the shower trays get so slippery, my kids must have slipped over 10 times between them how they didn't get hurt I don't know.We LOVE coming to Elvenden but this time it took the shine off the way we feel.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0

groupe_10,"Our family were lucky enough to afford a trip over Christmas and although completely extortionate, the extra facilities they provide for Christmas made up for it slightly.We actually had quite a nice lodge for once, 959, which you can see on their PDF map as being close to the water and it was! Beautiful view, not overlooked, set back from the road, and plenty for wildlife coming up to the patio. I would definitely recommend a south facing lodge as you get the sun pretty much throughout the day. The master bedroom is huge and faces the patio with the small twin room at the front.Lodge was very clean, we were missing a cheese grater and remote for one of the bedroom tv's but one call to maintenance and it was sorted straight away. Shower curtains are used at this Center Parcs which I prefer after a glass shower door smashed last time when I was a Sherwood Forest Center Parcs.The only thing that has made this review 3* is the awful restaurants. I get they are over priced, and have been going to CP for years to know this hasn't changed but the prices has been slightly justified by the quality of service and food. Neither of these happened on our visit to Rajinda Pradesh and Hucks Diner. Both we had to wait longer than our stated booking time to be seated and were left waiting for a long time, alongside other issues which I have raised in an ongoing complaint logged whilst there as I was so disappointed to the point I couldn't get much sleep thinking about how bad the family felt for my suggestion on going there.Now as I work for a tour operator I know the standard 28 day wait for a full response so will hopefully get a reply soon considering the complaint was logged on 23rd December.Saying that, I know not to eat out again at Center Parcs and to bring my own food and have a perfectly good meal in the lodge. I can't wait for Center Parcs to complete a full refurbishment of all lodges and please no more building work unless you consider buying more forest land! Also they FINALLY got the temperature right in the subtropical swimming paradise, it was warm! And if you visit around 6pm it is at it's quietest. Lagoon pool still feels like a piss pool with all the little kiddies in it so avoid and the lazy river feels really grimy and in need of refurbishment similar to the one at Woburn.

groupe_10,We have been visiting Center parcs sherwood for over 20 years.Sometimes two or three times a year the last three years only the once as the last few visits have been not very good.I keep hoping that the children will say they have had enough and we are tired of going now.It's rapidly become such poor value for money.Previously I haven't minded the cost as the facilities were so good but alas no longer.Its all about building as many villas and cramming in as many people as possible.Its overcrowded and the forest has all but disappeared.I suppose sooner or later this would happen when corporate greed overtakes the whole ethos of the forest experience.The villas are tired and dirty we stayed in a new executive which reeked of vomit when the heating came on when we reported to guest services they seemed disinterested and sent someone out to clean which left the villa damp but still smelling of vomit.On the second day the smell was worse than ever and we returned to guest services to ask to be moved they said no we are full to capacity( I didn't believe this to be true as although busy there was quite a few unoccupied villas). So the children slept with us for the remainder of the holiday.We stayed out most of the days to avoid the smell and found the pool way too busy and the water much colder than previous visits must be more cost cutting! The changing rooms smell of urine and half of the showers were not working.We didn't do any cycling as other than the roadway there is no forest left to cycle in.We did call in at sherwood pines next door on our way home just to have somewhere to cycle.The restaurants were poor and the kids buffet at hucks is dreadful.Unfortunatly I can't find anything good to say about the place which is a shame as we have many happy memories of previous visits.When I returned I complained and have been offered ¬£150 compensation which I will use for a weekend this year.Possibly Elvedon as we could just use it as a base to visit the seaside I certainly wouldn't return to sherwood as I believe the magic is gone.The facilities at places like haven are far better now and much better value for money.

groupe_10,"We have just returned from a Mon-Fri holiday at Centre parcs, the family is mum, dad and 2 year old.  Our expectations and desires were to have a quiet, car free experience where our little girl could have freedom to explore, roam and bug hunt and mum and dad could relax.We were allocated lodge cedar 272 at Sherwood, we did not pay for any additionals, arrived at 11am to make the most of the day, leaving at 2pm on the Friday.We booked 2 activities for Baby Owls and Soccer play (18-35Months) both were fantastic and kept our little girl entertained for the duration.  We went swimming on 3 occasions, it is a wonderful space and our little girl loved it.  All showers were working and the changing rooms didn't smell, however there is room for improvement, not enough and confusing layout.  The main pool temp was a little on the cold side, my little one is usually fine even in the colder pools we have been in but a couple of times she mentioned she was cold.  When the sun did make an appearance you can see how the greenhouse affect would correct this possibly too much.We ate at Hucks and the pancake house, both are fantastic.  Loved the indoor play at hucks, very well thought out, all the kids pretty much went in the same direction so no banged heads.I visited the Aqua Sana for an evening spa experience, this was wonderful and helped me to totally relax, some lockers in the caf√© or nearby would be nice to store money or pay on a tab at the end, was a little bit of a pain to keep going into the changing rooms.We went to the kids disco on Wednesday evening at the bowling alley.  it runs from 6.  They don't serve how food but the parc market is bang opposite and you can take food in.  All in all the best part of the holiday was seeing my little girl improve on her bicycle and be soooo tired she could do no more.  She splashed in puddles, went bug hunting, playing in the massive beach at the lake, went swimming, ate out, played football, held owls, fed squirrels and other wildlife with the animal food you buy in parc market.  It was wonderful and we have booked again already (but for another out of peak cheap rate holiday).Pros;wonderful staff, children at the heart of the holiday, well thought out, relaxing and private.  You can basically dip in and out of everything as you please.Cons;The biggest con I would say is that Tuesday, Wed and Thursday I expected to see no vehicles on the roads and was surprised by the volume.  I didn't feel comfortable giving my little girl total freedom on the roads, some staff drivers were faster than expected and didn't seem to have patience to wait.changing rooms at swimming, cold and complicated, not enough.everything does cost A LOT so eat and drink at villa, buy food to take with you.The wood burner is a waste of time, doesn't give off any heat and is just pretty to look at.  Having looked at the burner you would struggle to use other logs or coal as there is no circulation of air underneath, just a flat plate.  Im sure a pro may be able to work on something but we have a log burner and would have struggled with anything other than the overpriced Center Parcs logs.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

Check in staff very friendly and informative.Accommodation: We booked a new executive lodge as we found a 3 bed for Mon - Fri and at around ¬£500 we felt it was a good deal so booked it last year.The villa was nice, open plan kitchen / diner / lounge so everyone could be together whilst we cooked etc.Big comfy sofa, nice sized diner table, kitchen was fairly spacious and had pretty much everything we needed including a drinks cooler that was like a Tardis, (frying pans were rubbish).Patio area was ok but needed a good clean, but terrible weather so we didn't use it.We also had an outdoor sauna off the patio area which was nice, and easy to operate.We also had daily housekeeping and two dedicated parking spots just outside the lodge.3 bedrooms which were a good size, also each with ensuite, one with a hydro bath.Ensuite's made getting ready in the morning and evening easier and more private.Bad points: Radiators didn't work in several rooms cold at the top or one side, which we reported twice but nobody seemed to sort, just advised us on how to use the heating, we don't live in a cave and we do know the basics of thermostats, the rads need bleeding but we gave up in the end.Built under Fridge freezer very small, need to lose a cupboard and get a tall fridge freezer.Lodge a little tired a few fixtures and fittings worn, Bluetooth speaker in bathroom didn't work.Don't expect luxury, but a nice enough retreat where you can gather in comfort at the end of the day.Facilities:Swimming is always a number one crowd pleaser, enjoyed by all ages, we used the pool everyday.Plenty to do everyday you can never get bored but take plenty of cash most things seem to be ¬£30 minimum.We did a few activities between us all and a lot of swimming, Segways were entertaining.You can make it as active or as relaxed as you want.Generally we eat in the lodge but did eat out twice;Hucks Bar and Grill one evening which was very nice food and excellent service.The Country Club for breakfast on the last day, nice and again good service.Both a bit pricey but it is what it is and I would recommend both based on service and quality, especially Hucks.I went to the Sports bar one night to watch the football, the place is massive with more TVs than Curry's and they had 3 live matches on....I was in heaven. Plenty of seating and what seemed to be endless amounts of pool tables, ¬£2 a game though!!Unfortunately as with most venues on site drinks are ridiculously expensive at around ¬£5.30 a pint on average.So with 3 pints and 3 games of pool ¬£20 soon goes.Overall:We all really enjoyed it, we made it what we wanted and kept busy and I think reasonably cheap.Activities book up quickly so I would recommend trying to pre book what you can in advance.Take plenty of food and drink and unless money is no object limit the amount you eat out.Overall 4/5Accommodation 3/5Things to do 5/5Value for money 3/5Not sure if I mentioned cost :-)My top tips1. Keep looking for offers and you will drop on, book when you see an offer that suits, you can pay monthly.2.

The standard of the lodge was amazing once again with brilliant maid service  and Wi-Fi was available all over the parc. The hot tub for us was the icing on the cake  and was used every day.

Being Center Parcs of course you can soon spend a lot on activities but I think if you go in with your eyes open to that and plan a bit it's ok.  It's great to see some money being spent around the place as a few years ago it seems to be going down hill.  Some accommodations looks a bit tired now.  The staff are generally all good but like anywhere you will get the odd one who could do with a bit of coaching.  The new addition, at least since we went, of the electronic arm bands for accessing your accommodation and lockers is great.  Just a shame you only get one per room not per person as it's is a struggle with locker room.  You can get more from guest services for a small deposit.Food and drink is also generally of a good standard although I have thought for a long time it is a little over priced which is a shame as you feel you are being taking advantage of but it's good to see the prices in the Parc Market and more reasonable than they used to be several years ago.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
groupe_10,"On the last night of our stay the carbon monoxide alarm sounded, so I called the emergency number and security came out. They replaced the alarm and got an engineer to test that there was no CM in the lodge. I asked if there could be electrical issues as noted that all of the alarms were connected but this was dismissed. Not only did this ruin the whole nights sleep as The family now didn't get any, but we woke up in the morning to find water dripping from a fire alarm in a different room. I called guest services and explained how concerned I was and they said it would be fine and would send someone. After an hour no one had arrived so I called again and stated that I was not sure that they understood how bad it was and needed to get someone to look at it ASAP. On both occasions I made them aware that water was coming from the fire alarm. As we left the maid arrived and I explained the situation. She had said that she knew nothing of it and went in to investigate. She promptly came out and said that she had spoken to someone who told her not to go in the lodge as it was unsafe and dangerous due to the water leaking through the fire alarm. So... I would like to understand 1) why no additional checks were done during the night when the engineer came out to check the alarm 2) what are your processes in situations like that noting that the alarms are all connected to the mains power 3) why were we allowed to stay in the lodge for hours after I notified you of water dripping from the fire alarm when your staff are told that it is extremely dangerous and do not enter?

We needed a relaxing break with enough activities to keep our toddler entertained; it ticked all the boxes.Our woodland lodge was spotless, well-equipped and in a quiet spot at the far end of Birch. Our frequent duck and squirrel-shaped visitors were brilliant for our son. The only downside was that the log burner wasn't really up to much; you have to buy the pre-prepared logs from the supermarket and it's all a bit of a damp squib and waste of money to be honest.We took plenty of food with us but did eat out at Bella Italia which was nicely decorated, the food was lovely and the staff sang happy birthday to my wife. We also used the takeaway delivery on the last night which arrived bang on time and was surprisingly competitively priced when compared to the likes of Dominos and Papa Johns.We used the pool 3 times. It's very good, I took my son on some shoots and had no problem from the lifeguards - it all seems safe and laid back. The rapids, commencing in the outside pool and arriving down back near to the main pool, are really well designed. The toddler and baby pools are good but I take the point from other reviews about the temperature! For me it was just about ok and the water in the outdoor pool is lovely and warm - but the whole thing could stand being a degree or two warmer to be more comfortable. However, the changing room situation is poor. We had to wait for quite a while each day for a cubicle when we arrived and left; the facilities are not fit for purpose.Overall we had a great time. We love going away as a family and are generally glass half full type people- but we'd come back to Center Parcs.

We went for a weekend at the end of February and we were so disappointed. We had booked a 3 bedroom woodland lodge which was so small compared to previous stays in the same type of villa that there was barely room to swing a cat. But, the killer was the fact that there was a bedroom directly off the lounge which is just a ludicrous idea. The sofa was so old it was collapsing in the corner and really scruffy but, we were 6 people and with the bedroom entrance off the lounge, the usual extra chair was missing so we couldn't all sit down in the lounge! One of us had to sit on a dining chair. We all came to the conclusion that it was a 2 bed villa with a bedroom added as in the 30 years of going, that was never the format of the 3 bed villas. It was awful and the people in the lounge bedroom couldn't get to sleep if people were still up in the lounge! There are so many extra villas now that the pool can't cope with the sheer numbers. For the first time ever we had to queue for changing rooms to get in and out of the pool - every day we were there. That's never happened before and one day we queued for 25 mins. Just so sad - what used to be an annual family treat trip to CP, turned into a weekend of queues and even higher prices. Nearly ¬£40 for 45 mins bowling, on an old and faulty alley which kept messing up and ruined our game. We did get moved but it's just the sheer shoddiness of the place now.

We was told that our dogs were not allowed in anywhere on site while we ate or stopped for a drink. The weather was snowing and we went to the country club for some food and sat outside. We ordered 4 meals and 3 came out ready and my dads was not ready so we waited for his meal, by this time we had finished ours and was freezing whist waiting. The lodge was quite poor compared to other lodges we have stayed many times at Sherwood. The couch was plastic and poor quality. The seats was split underneath and we kept sliding of the couch, plus there was not one cushion on the couch. The decor was shabby and could see around the windows and fireplace of paintwork that needed touching up. The lodge had a dirty mop in a bucket for us to clean. I went to guest services and was not interested but said we will send someone to the lodge to examine the condition (they never came). We was told that center parcs was for children really and dogs were not catered for (however they let you pay 90.00 to bring them). We was told that our main motorway was shut on the day of departure and we raised this with guest services and was told it was not our problem, we can help you get your car out of the snow or even jump start your car if it will not start. We set off home with the two dogs and was stranded in Huddersfield and had to book a hotel for the night (with the dogs) an pay extra. We spoke to my Aunt who was worried and also is a regular visitor to Center Parcs herself and she informed us that Winfell and Longleat advised there guests not to leave the site if they could not get home safe, they was told to remain in the lodge and will get regular updates on channel 6.

We booked quite late and therefore had a lodge Hythe country club and a very good walk from the village centre what was a pleasant surprise was the car park at this end so we did not have to walk all the way back from the main car park. We booked an executive lodge and was not disappointed at all, clean tidy and everything u needed. Upon entering the first day we was greeted with geese knocking on the French doors with their beaks, thankfully thinking ahead I had brought some bird seed and after putting some out within minutes had geese, ducks, rabbits and squirrels on the patio our little girl wad completely mesmerized! When looking at activities my only negative was there is little to do with babies ours being just shy of 1 years old. We booked the fun pots with tots which was thoroughly enjoyed and Sam who helped us was absolutely lovely going out of her way to help with foot prints. We did find out that she could have gone to mucky pups as the ages stated was a guideline so was upset we had missed out on this. My only issue with the play areas is there was very little for babies and some swings added to the playground would be great to entertain little ones as well as some of the spring animals. The jardin de sport play area was the best for under 2's in my opinion but very small.We ate at the sports bar twice and on both occasions the staff were lovely making sure my daughter's allergies were catered for. The menus really help with this as detail what she can have without me having to ask or check online. We went to the pool twice on the first occasion we struggled to get a changing room and it is clear that there are issues with the locks working as u enter on one side and leave on the other. We was surprised about the temperature in there as it is described as sub tropical being 29.5 degrees well it definitely wasn't and we managed about 30 minutes before our daughter was shivering and her lips were blue. There is major refurbishment of the pool and it is definitely needed the baby and toddler area is tired, dated and dirty. There was water aids available so u do not need to take swim jacket altho our little one is small and therefore they were no good. The changing rooms can also be very cold and with a baby not ideal. I'm hoping all these issues will be resolved in the refurb. What u can t beat is the nature and the amount of geese, ducks , birds, rabbits and squirrels about which was great and we thoroughly loved the nature centre watching the birds etc. Would we come back? Probably not until all the refurb works completed but will hopefully be visiting a different one in the mean time.   ",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0

I imagine that our enjoyment would have been spoilt completely if there had been bad weather since the only included indoor activities seemed to be the skimming and slides and everything else was very expensive considering how much we had already paid for the weekend.Unless you have been lucky to get accommodation near to the 'village' you will need bikes to get around too and from your rooms. If you haven't brought your own bikes you can hire them but the cost is far too expensive band not least because they are the kind of bike that you would be able to buy cheaply in a supermarket somewhere and not not high quality or good to ride.The accomodation was okay and the bedrooms and bathrooms at least seemed to be relatively recently refurbished but overall the rest of the lodge looked like it needed a mild refresh with new paint etc again considering it was one of the higher priced rooms.The pool was good and we enjoyed it but was smaller than we imagined and if not for the good weather would probably have been far too busy.Good restaurants and the shop is well stocked but all are premium prices.I would try a newer Centre Parcs for another visit but could also repeat part of the experience by standing upside down and shaking all of the money out of my pockets.But as I said overall we enjoyed it but with some caveats such as a seriously depleted bank account.,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
groupe_10,"I'll start with saying that we visited this Center Parc's resort out of season &amp; during the heavy snow period that gripped Britton so I must give them some leniency during this review. 1st of all we have never been to one of these Parc's before so didn't book any attractions prior to our visit as we didn't really know what we were getting into. We (2 adults, 1 teenager &amp; 1 newborn) arrived on the site and had some humongous queues to deal with just getting checked in. The queues died down pretty quick as the staff were swift, it was just a manic time of day. We headed to the hut that we had booked and were happy with the initial cleanliness of the building. Unpacked the car to then find out that we weren't allowed to leave our car anywhere near the building and had to park it about a 15min walk away. ud83dude14Finally sat down and took it all in. Instantly found that the sofa was broken and when you sat down the bottom fell out, and the radiators were all rusty, so there was room for improvement but nothing to ruin the weekend. Turned the TV on which had a notice saying that ALL activities on the Parc were suspended because of the weather, so we were basically stuck on a parc with an indoor swimming pool &amp; shops. With nothing to do we decided to take a walk about the parc to kill the time. We found a few restaurants and a few shops which were all more expensive than their high street counterparts. We then decided that the best option would be to take a quick drive to the local ASDA or Tesco to stock up, which was about 15mins drive away. The 1st night was our worst night and pretty much ruined the weekend from that point onwards. We put the 3 month old baby in the supplied cot and went to bed. The heating decided to turn off at some point during the night, with the weather at -10. We woke up in the middle of the night, myself with a frozen stiff neck and the baby frozen through. We checked the heating and turned it back on &amp; put the baby in the bed with us to try to warm us all up. The heating turned off many times during the night meaning I had to keep getting up when I could feel the cold creeping in. In the morning I was in excruciating pain in my back and neck from the cold, so much so I was struggling to get out of bed or even walk. I checked the guest booklet in the lounge to find that the heating does turn off to help the parc become greener, but in my mind this was totally mental considering the weather outside. We went to the u201cguest servicesu201d to see if we could get the heating fixed for the next few days and I guess we weren't the only ones as I mentioned u201cheatingu201d and they immediately said they would get it fixed before I could finish my sentence. A guy come straight over and told us to basically hold the button and it would keep the heating on for 9 hours constant before we would need to hold it again. (Not in any manual, and basically a hidden feature). This was great news as it meant that we didn't have a cold night or day after this, but the damage was already done to my back and neck, which lasted about a week before I could turn my head again (I went through a whole pack of pain killers &amp; even contemplated A&amp;E it was so painful). We went to the pool, as it was all that was available to us for the weekend. The place was heaving with people and we really struggled to get a changing cubicle just to get into the place. After this, it was a pleasant couple of hours with plenty to do for adults and teenagers, but not much at all to do if you had a baby. You were allowed to take the baby through the baby pools &amp; to the larger pools without any issues from the staff, as long as they had the relevant swimming aids, but had to get out quickly when the wave machine alarm went off. We decided to visit one of the restaurants that evening and thought that we would visit one thats not on the normal high street. Dexters Kitchen was advertised as a restaurant but was really a cheap diner with extortionate prices. 3 simple burgers and chips came to over ¬£30. I felt robbed!The following morning we were basically stuck for ideas as there was nothing to do on the parc that we hadn't already done, so headed for the car and drove to Nottingham for a day out. We even had some family who lived about an hours drive away so paid them a visit just to get out. Back to the parc for the evening and decided to try the take-away u201cdineru201d which had a massive food selection of many coutures. Gave them a call for a delivery to be told that it would be a few hours. u201cI'm guessing because half the parc were ordering from themu201d. We elected to pick up the food which only had a 1 hour wait. Still felt robbed even from ordering a Chinese and Indian selection, costing about ¬£55.

I didn't get the mans name in the bike shop, but when my bike gained a puncture, he replaced the inner tube for free and gave my bike a quick safety check (tightened the brakes and adjusted the gears).As advised by others, we took our own food, which was good as we couldn't order food from anywhere as it was too late by the time we had settled.In the morning my children was delighted at the animals in the patio area. It was a very beautiful scene.The pool was absolutely amazing. My son especially loved the big slide, however this caused us issues as my daughter was 1inch too small - but I understand that it's for health and safety. (The changing rooms fill up quickly and it was frustrating to see single people using the family rooms).Everywhere that we ate was quite overpriced and the shop cost a lot more than the average shop - which we was warned about beforehand so was expecting it.My only downside to our little break was that I paid for my children to go rock climbing. I explained about my daughters disabilities, which I was advised was no problem. However, 10 minutes into the rock climbing, my daughter managed to stand on a crash mat under another climber on the wall, which resulted in the child falling onto my daughters head from a big height. I had to scream from the seating area where I was sat watching from, for a member of staff to help my daughter. They brought my daughter to me who was screaming/crying, holding her neck and complaining of a headache.I felt that first aid should have been administered there and then, as well as an accident form filled out - but the guys told me to carry my daughter to the medical centre (which was no easy task to do, especially as I had to ask other staff where to go as the guys on the rock climbing went back to what they was doing ud83dude44)The staff in the medical facility was really helpful and saw my daughter very quickly, but I feel it is quite concerning at the lack of health &amp; safety/ first aid knowledge from the staff in the rock climbing area.Fortunately after monitoring my daughter, giving her calpol and a cold compress, she was ok - but that is not the point.

You can get food delivered to them and even a bottle of wine. Kids had amazing time on the slides as did grown ups. Loved the kids disco at the bowling place. Precooked dinner at hucks and got a good deal two course and a beer/ wine for ¬£20.

Love that all the restaurants and pubs have soft play areas and as there are so many kids you can relax without worrying that your kids are super noisy as they are everywhere. Perhaps not the best place to visit if your not a fan of kids or noise...Tried to go out for dinner on Thursday night but hadn't preboojed stupidly and EVERYWHERE was booked till 8.30pm so ended up with an oven lasagne from parc market which was actually really good!!We did the pony rides but found it too short paid for15 mins and rude was over in 10.

The staff were exceptional during our visit. My son (12) was out biking with his siblings when he crashed and was badly cut and bruised. A staff member saw what happened, and by the time his dad was alerted and had run down the first aid team were already there. They not only brought him home, patched him up (very high quality plaster/bandages) and calmed him down but went above and beyond. They made sure to take him with me to another room to treat his cut hip, in order to respect his privacy. And they gave us extra bandages. (All of which stayed on throughout a later trip to the pool.)More than all that, they noticed that his reaction to the accident wasn't quite normal and were very calming towards him. My son has hearing difficulties and didn't have any warning when the crash happened. He was really upset and panicky, and the staff made sure that he was treated with great care. I really appreciated this; thanks also to the unknown man who picked him up before his brother and the first-aid people got there.The staff were exceptionally helpful throughout our stay, and it makes such a difference.

groupe_10,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this Center Parcs for a long weekend, Fri-Mon, and were disappointed for numerous reasons. 1. The accommodation isn't up to the high standards you expect with Center Parcs. We paid extra to stay in a 'new executive lodge' and when we were turned up, it was basically a tiny shabby old shed. We totally dispute the fact it was 'new' in any way, either it had been miss-sold to us or we were placed in the wrong lodge (433). The bedding had dirt marks on it and mould, the windows were single glazing, the fridge was so loud which wasn't relaxing in the slightest, the jacuzzi bath kept going off on its own, the bedroom was SO small there was no room to move about/put your belongings and both TVs were shocking, one was black and white the other had a fuzzy picture/a HDMI port that didn't work. Now this may not seem an important thing but when the activities are as expensive as they are, you want to make the most of your lodge. There was nothing 'new' and 'executive' about where we stayed. 2. The swimming area was disappointing. As other people have written, you had to wait for a cubicle to get changed. The water was cold and the pool itself overcrowded. 3. The whole place is looking a bit worse for wear. The accommodation from the outside is dirty and looks dated. I also found it to be again quite overcrowded; full of people and lodges on top of one another. After visiting both Whinfell and Longleat in recent years, Sherwood has really been shown up. 4. Apart from the Parcmarket, staff weren't particularly friendly or looked as though they wanted to be there. All in all we had a decent stay. We enjoyed some of the cheaper activities like badminton, table tennis, pool, mini golf etc and we had a nice meal at Cafe Rouge one evening.

groupe_10,"Firstly, I have tried to complain directly to CP but got such a generic response, I felt I should start to share my views with the rest of you.I didn't want to go. There, said it. I found Elveden below CP standards last time we visited, but now we live in Spain and fly back to Stansted, it was the closest for both us, and my eldest daughter who lives in Kent, to meet at.My Wife convinced me that ¬£2,500 to stay in a poorly insulated portacabin for a week to celebrate Christmas and my daughter's 21st birthday was a good idea.We knew that due to flight times we would arrive at 1am ish with no opportunity to shop so I ordered a family grocery pack when I booked so that the kids and grandkids would have something to eat in the morning. It wasn't there. They managed the overpriced Christmas tree and logs but no food.This became more of an issue than I first expected as my granddaughter was booked on an activity at 9am. Faced with the option of not going and wasting ¬£32 she went to the activity hungry. So began a customer service pattern. Ask once, nothing happens. Ask the second time and they have no record of the first time but still nothing happens. Walk in to customer service and ask in person and the issue gets resolved.When you choose your staff based upon their cost to you due to the current minimum wage, I suppose this is what happens. The cycle shop was another representation of this fact. I turned up there about 9:45 to collect my pre booked bike. I wish I'd known that I could have avoided a 15 minute wait while a poorly trained (please note this is a training issue and therefore management's fault, not that of the staff member) member of staff printed out the booked tickets for the horse and cart ride whilst chatting with the horse operator, while not once asking if she could help me (or the 4 people queuing behind me) Why carry out this slow operation at a customer facing computer? When she did finally acknowledge me, she told me I could just walk through and collect my bike. A sign to this effect would help.Even I am getting bored with my review now but there was more. From poorly cleaned ovens that not only set off the smoke alarm every use but also caused our eyes to sting and stream, to not enough towels for 6 guests that only took 2 calls to eventually rectify. The worst Thai red curry I have ever tasted that contained pineapple! A replacement dish that was just as bad. Freezing cold second and third bedrooms one of which felt like you had the window open despite the radiator being boiling hot. Three attempts to get a remote control for the bedroom TV that was missing (you can't even turn it in with any buttons on the tv)  Offensively overpriced drinks in the sports bar - you've already got a captive audience, why take the micky? A pint of Leffe at Cafe Rouge was cheaper for anyone that's interested and you can sit by the restaurant for just drinks.When the family grocery pack did eventually arrive a day late, to say I was underwhelmed would be an understatement. It should really be called a breakfast pack with a small bottle of coke and a packet of biscuits. Do not bother, it is a waste of money. I now realise why they do not provide a full list of contents before you order. Apart from that, as it was not there for our first morning, it was pointless, I could have just picked a few bits up from the shop until my daughter arrived on the third day. Did CP offer me so much as a breakfast voucher to make up for their failings? No, not a sausage. I am still waiting for my call from the manager, although I have now finished what will be my family's last ever stay at Center Parcs.We had friends nearby who we wanted to come as day visitors to have Christmas dinner with us but we were told there were no day passes left. They came down to meet us at the gate to drop presents only to be told that as they were here they could come in (if they paid of course) sadly, they couldn't as they had their dogs with them which they would have left at home if they had known.As a final note, perhaps you could use some of that huge profit you make, replacing the very large amount of bulbs that are not working around the site, in particular the final walking path that leads to pine, where there are more lights off than on. I. Could have walked around the site in one morning and noted every bulb that needed changing. Why can't you?

groupe_10,"We had never been to a Centre Parcs before and had had a lot of people recommend them. There were 4 adults, 2 children and a baby in a 4 bed woodland lodge and we loved it. Within minutes of being in the lodge a rabbit ran past the patio doors and there was a fairly constant supply of geese, ducks and squirrels at one or other of the windows during the week. We'd read some mixed reviews, including mentions of difficulties getting changing rooms for swimming but we never struggled. We rarely queued for anything at all. My only regret was attempting to walk to the outdoor activity centre before hiring the bikes. Once we had the bikes everything was smooth sailing. Every member of staff we encountered was great with the kids. The pancake house was fantastic, there was a birthday for one of our group and they did a birthday cocktail (with 3 balloons one for each child in the group), plus ice cream with a candle in.We ate at the lodge mostly with food we took with us. We did try the takeaway and whilst the Chinese and pizza was OK the Indian was alas not good. Mushy and confusingly flavoured. We had some plumbing issues but each time we called them and they were fixed by the time we returned. Overall I cannot wait to go again. ",1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

A couple of maintenance issues but these were dealt with quickly.Our first stay at Sherwood having previously stayed several times at Whinfell.  First impressions were that Sherwood is definitely looking more tired out of the 2.Sherwood feels a lot more compact than Whinfell however and a lot flatter making it easier to get around.We made use of most of the facilities - the pool complex was very disappointing and the main reason for the mark down. The changing rooms were very cold and very tired. We had to wait for a cubicle on a couple of occasions which is not great with a shiverring 3 year old. Once through the changing rooms the pool side did not seem that big due to some of it being closed due to refurbishment work. The water in the pools could also have done with being warmer.We did a couple of paid activities per day which were good fun but expensive for what they were - the kids loved the Mini Trek and the pony rides and the Aerial Tree Adventure was great fun followed by the zip line down over the lake.We spent every evening (7-9pm) in the bar area where they have a childrens disco.Would I go to Sherwood again? Yes, but only after the swimming complex has been refurbed which they claim is mid 2019.",0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0

I'd say it's more aimed at families than couples but we had a great time with our friends. The pool is superb loved it especially the outdoor heated pool but it was the only thing that was free. The lodge was lovely and quiet and had everything you needed, we wanted to take covers home! The freezer needs to be a bigger though to save eating out. Yes you pay for what you get but you don't get what you pay for. At Jardin de sport two meals and two drinks cost just under ¬£40 and you didn't get many chips with meal. Drinks prices are way too pricey. It's not abroad it's not London and people come here for an alternative to going abroad but prices really let it down with average pint being ¬£5/¬£6. Luckily we had brought some food with us and there was supermarket that sold everything but then couldn't fit much in freezer. Starbucks prices were same as usual so nothing too bad and the chocolate chunky shortbread was delish. We went to the pancake house, it was a bit too crowded there. We booked in advance but still had to que up to get table, with it being so popular it could do with extension, I can understand why it's so popular as the desserts are yummy! The ultimate chocolate waffle I have on photo was ¬£7.55 was lovely but again pricey. I think with custom they're making prices should be reduced. The bowling I wasn't really impressed with, expensive and you pay for 45 minutes or an hour but we were half way through second game. It would be more beneficial for those paying to pay for 2 or 3 games like at ten pin and the bowling alley does need a refurb so it's not like we're paying for amazing quality at ¬£7.50 each per person. You can play at tenpin for this and have 2 full games or even 3 or a free drink. The disco is a great idea as it's something for adults after bowling.We went to Jardin de sport this morning for breakfast, I had a pot of tea for ¬£2.60 which wasn't too bad as I managed to get 2-3 cups out of it but my partner had a coffee a normal coffee, the cup was tiny and it was ¬£2.25! As seen on photo. I would recommend anyone to go here for a relaxing break as it's a lovely place, it's a place you can go to forget everything and switch off, absolutely love the nature and animals but only downside is to be warned you need a lot of money as prices are ridiculous! I think centreparcs needs to review their prices and make it more affordable for people to go as people are choosing this holiday as an alternative to going abroad or just for an affordable getaway.

We took our own food as we knew eating out would be expensive but did have a couple of meals out, went to Hucks diner and the pancake house.  The festive lights were lovely, would have liked to hear festive music along the woodland walks. Santa visit was magical and our two grandaughters loved every bit of it.  Sitting in the hot tub on a frosty night was also magical, made even better by the visits from a family of Muntjac deer, which eventually ate out of our hands!  The swimming pool was great with some brilliant slides (check out the Cyclone for a breath taking drop) however, considering its called subtropical, we thought the water would be a bit warmer, didnt stop us enjoying it though.  All activities are expensive apart from the 10 pin bowling  which cost ¬£20 for an hour which we thought was ok.  The fireworks were very impressive including the high wire visit from Santa!

We had previously visited Whinfell CP but had no experienced any other CP. The week was really good fun but the weather was terrible due to the snow however, the staff did an excellent job clearing paths and roadways. The lodge was comfortable but was a bit tired and not that clean, the oven was really smelly &amp; needed a thorough deep clean. The main bedroom was freezing cold as it was like a prefabricated attachment but overall good value and fab to have squirrels, ducks and geese visiting us daily.My 3 year old son took part in 4 activities which were all fantastic and aimed at the right age - he absolutely loved the cookery school, roller skating and archery but the outdoor driving was not his thing as he'd never used an electric car before so it was a bit of a waste of money as he didn't really learn quickly enough for the length of the activity so I'd only recommend this for young children if they are already proficient using an electric car.The subtropical paradise was sadly a huge disappointment as the changing rooms were absolutely freezing which made the daily trip to the pool emotional for everyone. It was so markedly inferior to the experience we've had previously at Whinfell in similar weather conditions.  Unfortunately the automated doors were permanently open and there was no system of doors to keep the heat in and the freezing temperatures out.  The pool design also wasn't great for our children. The baby pool area is too small and the baby slide was too shallow and the toddler slide, like almost all of the others, are fully enclosed which terrified my toddler.The restaurants were lovely, especially the pancake house. Sadly, despite the excellent waitress, the Cafe Rouge food was really terrible and shockingly overpriced for the quality of food. The Indian restaurant was mediocre, with insipid curries which were again overpriced, although, the naans were delicious and definitely worth getting!Overall the week was great for the family I just wish we had gone to Whinfell again as the swimming experience was just so disappointing.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

In all we had a throughly enjoyable stay, but this was only because it was a chance for my family to get together.We arrived at Center Parcs to the usual cattle herding into the park and it took around an hour to reach reception. When we arrived at reception we were made to feel welcome by a friendly member of staff at check in, after a little confusion we were then directed into the set of maze runner, u201cI must say the sign posting is close to uselessu201d. We arrive at our lodge after running the maze and to be honest the lodge was fine, a bit tatty in places but in all liveable. After emptying the car we then had the job of taking our car to the not so secure carpark, PLEASE BE WARNED you leave your car in this carpark at your own risk, DO NOT leave anything in your car on view, this carpark is certainly not secure, we had our front grill badge stolen which is now going to cost ¬£68 to replace. We noticed some other cars that also had there badges removed, I spoke to center Parcs regarding this matter and we were basically told that you park in the carpark at your own risk because you chose to park there, in my opinion you have no other choice than to park in carpark so it is Center Parcs responsible to make sure the carpark is secure.We booked a few activities during our stay, u201cbe warned the outdoor activity centre is one hell of a trek and unless you have a duke of Edinburgh award you will need quite some time to find it.The swimming pool was great, the kids loved it, but don't leave your buggy outside unless you've chained it to something, we witnessed one very distraught lady who's buggy had been stolen. u201cTHE PRICESu201d what more can I say, if you don't get robbed in the carpark or the swimming pool, and from what I've read in other reviews your lodge, just head to any restaurant or shop because they will quite happily rob you blind, the prices in the restaurants are not just inflated they have literally exploded. All in all Center Parcs could be great if customers were there main priority, Center Parcs is obviously created to make money, and if your ignorant enough to fall for there over pricing and lack of customer care then you'll be fine.I am giving my review of the park 1 star, this is because of Center Parcs complete lack of customer responsibility when it comes to resolving a problem and the outrageous prices, like i said at the start of my review we had a great time, a holiday is what you make it, and we made ours one to remember, but this was no thanks to Center Parcs.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Our Lodge was a comfortable and spacious 3 bed Executive no. 746, an 8 minute walk along the edge of the lake to the village and slightly longer to the Venue. The heating broke down the first evening but a quick call to maintenance, who sorted it out, and warmth was restored! The wood burning stove and sauna both added to the cosy atmosphere. Our cleaner was so helpful, quickly rectifying a few minor problems. The activities were great and though quite expensive, not extortionate. The girls enjoyed the climbing wall and roller skating and we all played table tennis, badminton and 10 pin bowling. The pool slides were fun (even we grandparents went on them) and there was only a short queue each time, though I imagine in high season it's a different story. The external area was magical in the early evening, some folk even braving the plunge pool!The roads and paths were well maintained despite the thick snow and the shop was much better than we'd imagined.

Most of us hired bikes they were really easy to collect and have lights on them for a night and they are all serviced and in good condition. The staff at the bike place are really helpful and make sure your happy before you leave with your bike they also provide a bike lock because you will need one. Each place you go there is like a car park but for bikes. It's quite far from place to place but We all actually enjoyed going on the bikes places. Could not be more to do for children as well all the family was never bored also plenty for teens adults. The sports centre is amazing some really good things to do be played badminton a couple of times the courts are really good. We also did some horse riding and they was a great experience really well organised. And also like an adventure trail up high in the trees you are harness on and you do activities up high we really enjoyed it.

Many great choices and good service from the staff.Lots of places to shop like the little sweet shop and there is a supermarket should you need anything. There is a Starbucks. Loads to do.

Really sweet treat!We did just take some cereal so we could just wake up and have breakfast quite chilled but if you forget anything you can get this. The car park is very big just remember your letter you park in and it's fine. If you go to the spa there is some really good treatments to have done. A couple of us just went for the afternoon. We left feeling really fresh really relaxed. If you do like to stay up and have a drink a night that's fine there is plenty of places to do that.

We had a couple of issues.... just outside the door there was a brick that had sunk into the ground leaving a hole which I can only describe as an ankle breaker and the kettle was splashed with dirt and had a fair amount of lime scale. With us having a newborn baby I wasn't happy with the kettle. When we told reception literally within 10minutes of us being back at the villa they delivered us a new kettle ud83dude00 and the hole was filled in when we went out the next day.We went out for a meal at the sports bar the adult meals we had were lovely,but he kids meal of pasta and meatballs was terrible. It was dry so not much sauce and the heat was inconsistent.....can only assume it was microwaved. Not great standards considering it's a kids meal and what Center Parcs charge. We also had a meal at Hucks and this time i found a deal (never knew they did deals) the Hucks early dining deal which was a big sharing starter and then a choice of main meals. All of it was fantastic, we aren't really into having a starter but we were converted after this meal. We had the ribs as mains... amazing.Pool area great and clean as we're changing rooms, although with the family changing rooms near the doors we found it to be really cold getting dressed.

Sherwood really is like living in the forest - where Whinfell feels a little manufactured in our view.Loved the village feel and no real central hub (ie covered) as it made us spend more time outside, and in the unexpected snow, it was lovely.Sadly, the service in the country club needs looking at, we had booked to eat at 17:30 and after an hour, was still waiting for mains. There was only a handful of people in the pub so we could only assume they had very few staff on to serve people - this was a really disappointing experience.The indian was superb in every way - highly recommend it.The pool was the main attraction for us and our little one loved the big slides as well as the kiddies area (which in our view is better than whinfell) - the outdoor part of the pool was brilliant and it was strange with snow falling. I agree with other reviews that the temperature in the changing rooms was unacceptable and at best &quot;cool&quot; which is not great when its minus 4 outside.

groupe_10,"Having stayed at other Center Parcs we decided to try the Elveden Forest location.We booked a 3 bedroom Executive Lodge, No.937. (11/12 u2013 15/12)Upon arrival everything seemed ok, but little by little it became clear that there were issues with the cleaning regime or lack of it.Initially like most people, we were not going to let the fact that the cleaners had failed to vacuum the bedrooms to a reasonable standard bother us. It seemed a little unreasonable to me that my daughter did not want to share her bedroom with the resident spiders who were residing in their spectacular cob webs, one in each corner. It must have seemed a shame to the cleaners to damage such a work of art!My wife then pointed out that the fire had not been cleaned out and that it still had the remains of a previous fire in it. In true holiday spirit, I explained that even though we had paid a hefty sum to stay in the accommodation, we were not beyond cleaning the fire out, these things happen, anyone can make a mistake or two.It then came time to cook our evening meal. With commendable persistence my wife battled to get the oven to light, I feel sure that this could become a new official Center Parcs activity in the future, such is the satisfaction felt by those who are successful.It then became apparent that the room was filling with smoke, we were all impressed with the smoke alarm and how loudly it sounded. Alas, no one came to check we were still alive or if we needed assistanceu2026..it appears that that the Customer Services team must be use to this kind of lame ploy to gain their attention.Once the smoke had dispersed, it could be clearly seen that the oven had an oily substance all over the bottom of it, and yes, this too had not been cleaned.I must admit that by this time even my holiday spirit was getting pushed to the limits.My daughter decided enough was enough and that she would phone the Customer Services department.Their initial response seemed encouraging, they said they would arrange for us to receive a ¬£40.00 credit for us to use at the 'Dining In' take away service as the house keeping would not be available for at least an hour and a half.I am not going to get distracted by discussing the inflated cost and mediocre quality of the meal here, that's a whole different subject, but as they say, it's the thought that counts.The next day after returning from the Rangers walk it was clear that the oven still had not been cleaned.Cue my daughter contacting Customer Services again. This time it was proving a little more difficult to get a firm commitment as to when the oven would be cleaned. My daughter requested to speak to the Manageru2026.they said they would get them to call her back, never happened.At 13:00 a lady came to the Lodge door and asked if we needed her services? I asked if she had been sent by the Customer Services department, but she knew nothing of our reports regarding the oven.I decided it was time for me to take a visit to the Customer Services team in the Sports Plaza to give them a little more detail as to how they were doing as a department.I gave a brief overview of the problems we had experienced regarding the poor standard of cleaning in the Lodge and the poor communication we had experienced from their department. I was immediately informed and reminded that they had very graciously provided us with ¬£40.00 credit to get our evening meal. This was said in such away that made you realise that this person had no idea of the price of the food on said menu and most certainly can't have tasted the quality of the food.I summarised the issues we had experienced regarding the poor standard of cleaning and lack of communication from their department and then waved a white flag and retreated, as it was clear that in her eyes I was just another complaining Customer.Later that afternoon we received a letter from the 'Guest Service' Shift Manager. It statedu2026 that they had been unable to contact us to discuss the accommodation issues which we had reported.It left me wondering, in which way had they had attempted to contact us, my phone had no missed calls, I had not received any emails?The letter then requested that I visit Guest Services in the Sports Plaza (Where I had just been) or ring them directly (which we had tried to do earlier). This letter was symptomatic of the whole shambolic experience.I have completed the Center Parcs 'Feed Back' survey and have ticked the box giving them permission to use my comments in any future advertising material, I somehow doubt they will, though I am hopeful that 'Oven Lighting' will make it onto the official activity list!Good Bye Centre Parcs, I'm done.",1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0

The accommodation (Oak - executive lodge) had plenty of room for the four of us but needed some cleaning and maintenance; single glazed and draughty windows, a shower which you literally had to run around under to get wet with and the rug and sofa should probably have been thrown on the fire if it weren't for the plaque stating only sanctioned and extortionately priced 'smokeless' Center Parcs logs could be used - bringing me on nicely to my next point. From the minute you arrive, you can't help but feel like you're being grabbed by the ankles and shaken for every penny you have, everywhere you go. Apart from the swimming, nothing is free and now they're even trying to extract cash from you while you're doing that. A shop, a cafe and a Starbucks around the pool, a theme park style photographer loitering intently while you swim with your family and a private hire teepee shack type thing with plastic chairs and a TV that you can rent out. The food at the restaurants is ok but again hugely overpriced for what you get and the takeaway (Dining In) was eye-wateringly expensive. For three curries, two rice, naan and bahji it was just over ¬£55 (and the curry was horrible). A kids cheese toasty in the sports bar was about ¬£7-8 and was literally just a toasty from your regular Argos sandwich toaster. The officially sanctioned 'crackle logs' for use in the open fire were close to ¬£5 (for reference, you can get a bag of 12 heat logs from Homebase for ¬£4). Having visited Center Parcs a few times before I knew to expect inflated prices for everything, but it feels like it's been pushed that much too far now and it detracts from the experience, which overall, was very good.The Elveden site also suffers from a lot of noise from the nearby airbases which perform various loud training exercise every day from around 8am to 7-8pm. Apparently this is mentioned in the small print of the terms and conditions but as part of the Center Parcs experience is meant to be relaxing in a peaceful and tranquil setting, they could be more upfront and honest about this.",1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0

Elveden is almost 5 hours drive for us but knowing we didn't then need the car once there, we didn't mind. Arrived around 1pm and had to queue to check in for half an hour. Not a great start, we have never once queued at Sherwood. We paid extra this time for a 'newly refreshed' lodge. Neither myself or my husband could see any difference at all other than a walk in the lounge area was a different colour. The sofas still looked old , along with stained carpets. Won't fall for that again! My husband laughed at me for taking antibacterial wipes but when I showed him the colour of one after I had wiped the kitchen worktop, he understood why I did! The levels of cleaning are poor. A quick flick around with a mop and a cloth does not count as cleaning Centreparcs. These villas should be deep cleaned regularly and they clearly are not. The village itself is well laid out and well maintained. Our 4 year old daughter did some fantastic activities: crazy science, princess party, adventure golf to name a few. All the staff were brilliant and the activities were well organised. Eating out was hit and miss. The Indian isn't a patch on Sherwood, but the dining In was very good. Hucks was still poor here, small portions for large prices. Plus, being pregnant, I really didn't appreciate the waitress coming up and putting both hands on my bump. Highly inappropriate and huge invasion of my personal space. Even my husband was shocked. Centreparcs is one of those holidays that each time I find things that really annoy me, but it's so amazing for kids, and to see how happy it makes my daughter is why we keep coming back.

groupe_10,"I have just had a weekend at Centre Parcs Sherwood Forest and have come away not just disappointed but pretty angry. This was my first trip to a CP, but had always heard that they were pricey but fantastic. When we booked I had to double check the price, it was so high. I travel a lot both for business and pleasure, so when it comes to holidays, i always like to pay a little extra to make it feel special. So I thought to myself 'it will be worth it.' How wrong i was. Our accommodation that we paid so much for was pretty average. Log cabin type accommodation is popping up everywhere now, and this fell way below modern standards. It was also let down further by a strong smell of sewerage in the kitchen area and one of the bedrooms. The second huge bugbear for us was cars on site. It took us an hour from joining the queue to get in the gates to getting to our lodge. This made us late starting our plans so elected to leave our cars parked outside the lodge. Particularly as we were located in a quiet dead end corner at the opposite end of site to the car park. The next day we were left a note threatening us with removal from site if we didn't move our car to the car park. So we were forced to move our car to a full car park. This was challenging and dangerous in the middle of a busy Saturday afternoon. We then couldn't find a spot in the car park so had to park on a muddy verge. With the walk back to our lodge, this took almost another full hour out of our weekend. This was obviously repeated the following day retrieving our vehicle. We did the quad biking on the Sunday morning. This was the adult version, so for ¬£45 per person, was thoroughly underwhelming to just spend 30 minutes playing follow my leader at a snails pace. All other activities we tried to book, we decided against due to the exhorbitant price. This left us spending a lot of time in the grossly undersized pool area. Not nearly big enough for the ever expanding accommodation numbers. Finally the food. I was suprised and disappointed to find the site full of chain restaurants and cafes. We had dinner in a pub style restaurant. It was Wetherspoons quality with gastro pub prices! I won't visit a Centre Parcs again, as I could have a high end log cabin with a hot tub for less. All without the barrage of cynical money grabbing schemes. The best things in life are free, and that certainly goes for beautiful countryside.

It came off pretty effortless so i can't why it was on there unless it wasn't cleaned before our arrival. So glad we brought anti bacterial wipes with us as there was what appeared to be dried blood on a bedroom door surround and well as black mould on the wall &amp; around the air vent.There were no pillow cases sheets or duvet covers in one of the rooms, so we had to take to go to customer services to request this be addressed, it was about 3 hours later during dinner time, which wasn't to much of an issue by a lovely lady who apologised.

groupe_10,"We came along with bikes on the roof rack and queued for over1 u00bd hours to get in and take our things out of the car while they were finishing off spraying the trees with their winter wonderland spray. Our pine lodge was ok and we walked to the main office to get information about cycling outside CenterParcs . Unfortunately the elderly lady had no idea where we could go or any useful information. Walked back to our lodge which was clean and tidy a good start. By 11.00 pm cars were still parked and driving around the site and we had to jump out of the way into the wood so next morning we cycled past at least 45 cars still parked by 10.30 am that morning and discussed this with office staff and were told parking slips would be placed on their windscreens. So much for a car free environment.Then low loaders and highway lorries came in for the new hotel being built on site plus all the noise of a nail gun firing off during the day. This was then added by the fighter jets flying overhead form the local runways just down the road. So much for a quite peaceful tranquil forest well away from the city noise and pollution. The Corporate Company policy has pushed the prices very high in the restaurants and the bars to the point of really wanting to take the customer to the cleaners, even the so called supermarket prices are too high and if only everybody would boycott CenterParcs restaurants the management might eventually get the message.The next day we cycled around the park and got stuck behind lorries resurfacing the roads around the lodges with new tarmac. As I cycled past one of them my front wheel got caught in a cut out area and went straight over the handlebars with a forward roll onto the road in front. Lovely big bruises down my left leg and knee cap catching the tree logs beside the road. Perhaps it might have been my fault for not looking more carefully when cycling. Great start to the week there. My wife booked up in the middle of the week for the Aqua Sana at 12.30pm for a session but when she got there they had put down the wrong time for 1.30pm. Off to the cafe next door to wait. The lady at the entrance apologised and told her that she could come back for an extra session the next morning on the day we were leaving and put her name down. Nice touch CenterParcs.Went to give the lodge a cleanup with the nice newish looking blue Numatic vacuum cleaner and found the cotton Hepaflow bag full to the very top with ashes and dust. No point using it until I found an incorrect paper bag that just about fitted. Young staff cycling around don't carry these items also we had three tea spoons and not four in the cutlery drawer so please don't charge us for a missing one. Come Friday we started the lovely great queue to get out and stayed just about static for a good hour and then I smelt exhaust fumes coming in and the engine started to shake badly so we had to pull into a small lay-by near a lodge and put the bonnet up. Another forty minutes went by while the other cars tried to turn left onto the main road from Pine Lodge. Nobody there to act as a road marshal. Tried to get the attention of a member of staff who told me that this was standard practice at Elveden? We managed to phone up the nearest dealer in Norwich and crawl down the A11 and of course by then it was too late to go to the Aqua Sana for my wife's extra visit that morning plus a bill for ¬£665.00 from the garage. Perhaps if you happen to live at the end of Heathrow Airport and enjoy nail guns going off most of the day and new tarmac being laid down on the so called cycle routes then it might not worry you but it was not my idea of a quite relaxing holiday with disgusting over pricing since the big boys have taken over CenterParcs. Taking children there for Winter Wonderland and the firework display on Wednesday night is very thrilling for them and great enjoyment for the family but not being a member of the Chelsea tractor brigade I for one will not be paying their prices for food and drink and instead pop into Thetford supermarkets but then you try to find a parking space when you come back?",1.0,0.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

groupe_11,"Have just returned from CP Sherwood Forest after a half term mid week break. After visiting this park on several occasions both with and without family this is definitely the last. It's certainly lost the idilic 'magic' it once had which is very sad , but it is no surprise when so much additional accommodation has been added over the years and now hundreds of more people are packed into the the same area and cram into the dome, pool and slides , a 'sub tropical paradise' it is no longer. Another spoiler this year was the watering down on the outdoor activities, which on appearance looked to be due to a reduction in staff levels. The new 'Aerial Adventure' course was pretty disappointing being more a series of 'walks' offering little challenge to my ten and twelve year old daughters, compared to the old course I'm sure it's serves CP well as a low maintenance continuous conveyor of ~¬£30 a head fee paying holiday makers. We also gave the 'High Ropes Challenge' a go this year having done so a few years back - what a disappointment. No longer split into groups of four/five people per instructor but now just two instructors for the entire group, consequently your 'challenge' was to spend 4 lots of 25 minutes stood in the freezing cold (everyone had dressed for climbing) waiting 'your turn' which took about 5 minutes or less, so having paid ~¬£30 each,  a total of 4 climbs in two hours DOES NOT REPRESENT FUN OR VALUE. Other niggles which take the shine off a not inexpensive short break were, paying ¬£13 for a Sports Bar burger which clearly was not freshly cooked, wanting to take a morning coffee in the Country Club but reality is there's no where to sit - it's rammed, getting jostled and bumped in the busiest set of water slides I've ever had the misfortune to experience, having to wait for one of a handful of lukewarm showers amongst n thousand people and always having to wait for a cubicle to change in both before and after using the pool. In short , for us at least the Sherwood site has cast away its charm, its magic and its attraction, rather the direction for a long time has clearly been to just get more and more people into the same limited facilities, what a shame.",0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0

groupe_11,"We booked to stay in an executive studio lodge in Feb half term week. Upon arrival there were long queue's to check in which wasn't great, but we did arrive at half 3 and we knew that you could enter the lodges from 3. When we got to our lodge we were pleasantly surprised. Tip: don't bother paying extra for a specific lodge or area. We didn't pay and our lodge was an 8 minute walk to the village square and backed onto a private little river. The lodge was very clean and had a 'clean' smell upon arrival. They provided dishwasher tabs, a sponge and cloth, coffee capsules to go in the coffee machine and some dish soap. There were also some basic toiletries in the bathroom. We were pleasantly surprised by the bed, online it was described as a double but it was actually definitely a king size! The only disappointment was the lodge description said we would have a hydrobath. However in our bathroom there was only a regular bath with a weak shower over it - a shame as we were looking forward to a nice bath! The studio lodge is perfect for couples, but I would not recommend it for families/ Mum &amp; daughter etc as there is no door to the bedroom and it is very open. Perfect for couples though! The park itself is beautiful. I hand fed squirrels and ducks and you can buy proper squirrel/badger food at the supermarket for ¬£3.99. You can also buy logs at the shop but these are ¬£9.99 for only 4 small logs! I'd bring your own, however on the burners it states you can only use logs bought from the centre Parcs super market (slightly annoying). The supermarket is very well stocked with everything you could need. Tons of food options, a fresh bakery, medicine, alcohol, magazines &amp; cards etc. But it is pricey!! There are tons of activities on offer. We did pedalo, mini golf, bowling, geocaching and a trip to the spa (as well as lots of walks and exploring). All of these I highly recommend. However, we prepaid all of these and yet when we went on the pedalo's they didn't ask for any proof of booking (for any boating activity) and we went straight on. Another couple we overheard hadn't paid and got on too (so we felt like we had wasted money!). The other issue we found was that if you try to be organised like us and book activities in advance, if you then wish to cancel (I had tonsillitis whilst we were there and was rather unwell), you can't get a full refund. You can only get a 50% refund if cancelling within 72 hours of the activity. So if whilst you are there you decide you want to change your itinerary, it leaves little room for flexibility. For this reason I wouldn't really recommend pre-booking activities. We went in half term week and anything we wanted to do we could book on to on the day with no problems. Nothing seemed booked out! However that does show the good availability they offer. I wold highly recommend exploring the park when you first arrive. The geocaching activity or the treasure trail are designed to show you hidden areas of the park and give you a sense of direction! We hadn't realised all the nature huts and hidden restaurants existed without it! Overall, centre Parcs isn't cheap. But it was a lovely relaxing mid week break.

The reason for 4 not 5 stars was mainly to do with the issues we had with the cabin electrics, boiler, tv which made for a very frustrating first nights stay before everything was sorted out (by 2 visits from maintenance staff)  Not an ideal start.  After everything was sorted the stay was as expected.  Lots of walking, swimming, shopping, eating an drinking.  Exactly what we went for!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0

groupe_11,"We spent a weekend at this place, we did enjoy every single minute we were there. We had a place with 3 rooms with a bathroom in each room,  a kitchen and a living room with a bbq area outside. Rooms were big enough for two people, we had a baby (9 months old) and it was good enough, we didnt have any problems in the room being with a baby, the hitting worked fine.  They cleaned the rooms every day which was really nice. There are lots of things you can do, whatever you prefer to be outside or in the warm. The indoor pool was really nice, it's warm and nice for the kids. Make sure you check for the hours when they open the pool for kids in the morning, they let kids enjoy the pool for a little bit before it is open for everybody else.The restaurants are located near the pool, which is good for lunch, they were very good, and the staff in the restaurants were really nice, service is quick.One night they had fireworks by the lake, it was really nice watching, i was surprised for the amount of fireworks they displayed, it last about 15 minutes!.In the activities they have i remember seeing: pool tables, ping pong tables, Badminton, bowling, painting, arcade games, mini disco for kids and many more.Also you have to rent a bike to move quicker in the park.There is a gym, small but enough to keep you fit while in holiday.The clothes shops have decent prices, prices are like in any other shopping mall. If you dont want to eat at the restaurants you can get your groceries at the mini supermarket by the pool area. I would recommend this place for a family holiday with kids or just for a couples looking for a relaxing time in the forest.Some things I think they could improve on:- When driving in to check in, there should be a different way to make it quicker, we had to wait like 15 mins but i bet some other had to wait more and its not ideal if you are traveling with babies. Maybe somehting like the drive-thru that you see in the fast food restaurants would work. - In the changing area (pool) there should be a staff member like coordinating the queue for the changing room and checking that families get to use the family changing room, we had to wait with our baby to get a changing room, and we saw like three couples coming out of the family rooms, i think they need someone to make sure the family changing rooms are used only by families with babies.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
groupe_11,On the plus side the Christmas decorations are amazing and the place had a lovely Christmassy feel.On the downside it was 0c whilst we were here and the whole of the pool area and water was cold both Saturday and Sunday. There was a sign up on the Sunday saying they had problems with the air temperature and it was getting fixed. My grand children ( along with other children) were shivering in the children's pool area and when I queried with the staff why there was cold air blowing from the ceiling I was told it was to regulate the temperature! The Rapids were freezing so we went down once then gave it a miss. The water in the villa was barely hot most of the weekend and upon complaining someone came and cleaned the shower head and said it would be ok.We come here as a family twice a year and with centreparcs charging top money they should be providing top service. In my daughters villa the cleaner took their towels and didn't leave anymore so upon going to customer services to ask for some more we were told that there was no one available to drop any off so we would have to carry them back ourselves ( which we did!) we had a great time in the summer here so hope this is just a one off and not a sign of a place going downhill,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Check in fast &amp; easy, lady was friendly happy and had a Xmas hat on,we were given 4 mini chocs which the kids loved! headed over past the friendly elf's who chatted to children &amp; adults alike, stopped to watch the singing reindeer-fab! The place was magical with xmas decorations, beautiful fairly lights and lots of free activities. We could see the real reindeer every day, we could stop and watch the singing reindeer, there was a lovely display with a snow machine which was great for photos, there was a huge snow globe on the Tuesday which you could go in and play and have your photo taken (free), there was a small brass band singing carols on wed evening outside the main doors (free). The fireworks display was fantastic, with music and a real good mixture of fireworks (free). We paid ¬£28 to visit father xmas (¬£14per child) some may say this is too expensive and at first we agreed, however it was the best father xmas we have seen. It was an experience as you checked in with an elf and then walked along the elf path past the workshops and other xmas things, then were greeted by another elf who took you in to see the big man. The room was beautiful and he was an authentic father xmas, we didn't feel rushed, the elf in the room was also helpful as we had an hysterical 2year old!!  Lastly you receive two free photos of really good quality, our elf took a few for us and told us we can have them however we like she was really helpful and again didn't rush us or anything.

Cabin was dirty: Dirty grill where someone had cooked cheese - was left - didn't use.Plug socket hanging off in living room.Toilet wasn't cleaned either.Staff unhelpful/unfriendly:Cafe Rouge: Asked question twice about whether they do afternoon teas. Staff said they would find out, but never bothered coming back to us. Left us waiting for 30mins. Whether lacking knowledge or bad at their job, who knows.Fireworks: Were actually very good. We stood by the lake and then got asked my a rude/arrogant security lady &quot;Are you on the list&quot;. Didn't bother explaining what this 'list' was. Just moved us behind some bushes for a nice restricted view.Security: When taking packing our cars up on Sunday evening, was told in no uncertain terms by Security at the gates that we had 1 hour to pack stuff and bring car back as we were leaving early doors on Monday. Very aggressive and jobsworth like.Snow machines: Had apparently run out of snow! Shocking.The only thing good about this trip was the swimming pool, which is still excellent.The whole experience is geared up about sucking every penny from people. I have already filled a questionaire out, as I know about Customer Service having worked at TUI/Thomson for 16 years, where customer satisfaction is key. Unfortunately, Center Parcs run at a very high capacity, so if people complain or don't go back, then there is a queue of people waiting to take their place, meaning the customer satisfaction and repeat custom isn't key to them.I've been to Center Parcs on many occasions over the years and have seen a downward trend in quality. For the price we paid for a 3 bed villa (¬£900ish) could have seen us book places like California Cliffs (Park Resorts). The swimming pool obviously isn't a patch on CP, but you get entertainment and honest staff and security that care about customers and holiday makers. For the price of the weekend in Center Parcs, I could have gone to California Cliffs for 4 weekends! No contest for me after my recent experience, and I will not be going back to Center Parcs again.Eventually, this company will start to lose custom as you cannot continue to operate like this. Shame on them. I haven't had a response from my original satisfaction survey sent to me after my stay, but somehow don't think I will.

We had no hot water for 3 days and had to call and chase the senior Duty manager 5 plus times regarding the matter. No one transferred the problems we had over to any other staff or maintenance t am, So we had to repeat our problems several times. No follow ups were provided and after having several different maintenance staff in the house for over 5 hours at a time with no hot water and young children, we finally had a duty manager visit the house and was apologetic and offered us compensation for our inconvenience. We finally thought we were going to start to have a better service. But the. Cleaning staff came this morning and we asked for clean bed sheets for one of the bedrooms as my 2 year old was sick due to drinking water to fast. We were told they may not be able to clean today as it could be sickness and diarrhoea. We ensured this was not sickness and diarrhoea but sheets were left at our door and no cleaning completed. We informed guest services and spoke to a duty manager who assured us the house would be cleaned for our returned to the house in the evening.

Many extras would have been fully booked or only available at inconvenient times so read the website thoroughly and decide early. Father Christmas (we booked early for day of arrival) was the best we have experienced giving everyone plenty of time and both children were overawed. We brought our own bikes which is a big saving and we all enjoyed the traffic free riding around the park it boosted the confidence of the four year old. The water park has numerous features with something for everyone. The fireworks midweek were excellent and we had booked for the Panto which is performed by staff members not professionals so we expected to be underwhelmed but that was not the case. It was hilarious and so thoughtful with all the children getting time for pictures with the whole cast in front of the stage afterwards. Yes the extras are expensive especially drinks in the bars but if you look at the overall package it is good value. Self catering would reduce expense but also it would reduce the experience. A torch is essential for getting around the complex in the dark. Some signs and maps are not illuminated too well.

groupe_11,"Center Arcs has always been a little pricey but in the last few years, it is clear that their charging policy of paying for everything except fresh air above any customer consideration is the way to go. More and more villas have been crammed in here at Sherwood and everywhere seems packed, constantly. The food hasn't improved, very difficult to find any healthy options and the prices for this mediocre food is astronomical. I used to come to centerparcs and accept that it is a bit expensive but now I just feel that we are being ripped off at every turn. The subtropical swimming pool is anything but subtropical, cold, dates and small. Every morning before 8am, outside our villa we had a JCB with front roller going back and forth, causing the villa to shake. This went on for hours and every day we were there so no relaxing lie in for us. Eveytkme we wanted to turn the tv on we had to empty the cupboard under the sink, pull out the plugs, wait a few minutes and put them back in before the tv would work, we were advised to do this by guest relations, fixing th3 problem permanent seemed to be a bit of an effort for them. Everything here is a bit tired, ripped sofas in restaurents and so on which is annoying when customers pay sooooo much for the u201cpleasureu201d of staying here.after visiting all the different centerparcs the last 20 years with our family, this will be the last time, I just loathe leaving a place where we feel ripped off.

Forty minutes later we emerged at the check-in hut place. Once checked-in we were directed to a red and white barrier off to the right and we were in. But it was only ten minutes before the mad rush entrance at 3pm. PROS - We did get in early, just about. CONS - ¬£40. Also it's a bit hit and miss whether it's going to work or not, depending on the queue. To summarise - a good idea, if a little expensive. But not really thought out. We'd perhaps do it again, but arrive a little earlier, but not too early because I can't see where you'd go in the mean time. Center Parcs, to their credit, have said they will refund us for this.

But, apart from the latter I feel CP has changed what they were famous for and this makes me feel so disappointed.I may be alone in thinking this, but the commercialisation of the village and huge numbers of visitors has taken away the magical atmosphere it once had. I am baffled as to why there are so many Starbucks', chain restaurants and clothes/sunglasses shops which always seemed empty (except for sat night). I would love to see independent restaurants which offer great food unfortunately the chain restaurants are the only option for value for money. I would also love to see more local speciality shops such as a Delhi/cheese/pie shops etc which reflect the local area too. The whole park is too busy, I was nearly hit by a boy on his bicycle (not blaming him) who swerved to avoid a barrage of cyclists and I really felt for guests with disabilities as they not only had to battle the cyclists but the traffic too on checking out day. Another disappointment was the spa which lacked variety but I did love the warmth of the pool which far exceeds Woburn. Thankfully some things haven't changed such as the pleasure of wildlife knocking at our door every day for their feed and the wonderful staff at CP who were very welcoming. I feel there is so much more that could be done to match CPs 'old' ethos as a woodland break, just add some bird feeders, enhance natural habitats and scale back the visitors!

groupe_11,"We have had many magical family holidays at center Parcs and were so excited at returning after a break of almost 10 years only to be sorely disappointed. We should have been aware of an overcrowding issue when at arrival at around 10 30 there were no spaces in the car park and we were told to park outside the villa and we had to drive around looking for an open barrier, meeting various other frustrated customers and then queue to park up. After a ridiculously long wait for food at the over crowded outlet we ventured into the pool. Twenty minute wait for a changing room! Then a packed pool, no where to sit or put towels and really cold. I notice that the replies to reviewers from Center Parcs have not addressed the temperature of the pool area during half term week. Some days we had to leave because the water and air temp was so cold. On Friday the showers were freezing, I was told somebody would look at them but 2 hours later they were no better. We were really concerned about safety due to the numbers of visitors and the very few life guards. I know small children should be watched by their parents but sadly this was not the case and several were messing about in the whirl pools and running along the side of the pool and we didn't see any life guards on that side of the pool. The changing area and toilets smelled very unpleasant. The sink in the ladies outside had furry stuff growing in it and other toilets, especially in the Pancake house smelled really bad.The villas when we finally got in were shabby and the floors dirty. The twin beds are only 2ft 6in which maybe ok for children but we were 10 adults in 2 six person chalets and the narrow beds made for very uncomfortable nights. I notice that the center parcs replies about the high prices always say that they are competitive but most budget hotel chains now provide clean rooms, comfortable beds, soft towels and nice linen. Our expensive villa had none of these and the one and a half rolls of toilet paper in the villa was of the cheapest kind you can buy. The most frustrating thing about the villa was the temperature I had to call guest services who confirmed that it regularly reset to a preset low temp, which meant every morning the villas were freezing. This is apparently for ecological reasons. It is a pity that Center Parcs didn't have ecology in mind when they tore up the woodland around the Country Club to build some ugly villas and put a car park right next to the Nature Centre and bird hide. The feeling that you are staying in a forest has disappeared. Going back to heating the villa, they insist you only use logs from the Parc Market in the fire, a log there costs over ¬£4 compared to ¬£1.50 for the same thing in a normal supermarket.The positives were that the overworked staff are all friendly and helpful and we enjoyed the activities we booked. We would have booked more fitness activities but there were not many on mid week. The meals we had were all good, especially the Pancake House and the Sports Bar, but the tables could be cleaner and we wouldn't eat in Forresters Inn because it was so dirty.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0

groupe_11,"Travelled here with husband and 2 and 4 year old for a Friday to Monday break. We have visited before but off peak season and always Monday to Friday. This was our first winter wonderland visit. We stayed in lodge 833 which I chose specifically so could walk everywhere and the kids scooter. I was worried about noise and lack of wildlife as was so close to the centre but we had daily deer visits, peacocks, squirrels, voles and lots of birds. Noise was also not an issue, and was great being able to nip back to the lodge to dump wet swimming gear and worked perfectly with small kids. Previously we have stayed in an executive lodge and a 4 bed with hot tub as we had a larger group. This time just a woodland lodge but with just 4 of us this was perfect, ample space and clean and well maintained. As it was my husbands birthday we went a bit all out and ate out a lot. Friday night at hucks, the service was shockingly bad and the food isn't great, the kids buffet in particular is terrible. We only went because of the kids soft play and it's probably not worth it! Saturday lunch we ate in the pancake house, food yummy, service good, son at 4 at the upper age of being able to use the soft play, but fine for lunch. Sunday we went to cafe rouge Sunday roast, food was great and service was really good. Soft play is good but a bit small and cramped leading to lots of tears from kids being unable to climb around due to lack of space. But we did enjoy it here. And Monday we went for brunch at foresters inn. Probably the biggest surprise as I'd read bad reviews but the breakfast was great, and the play area is really nice for my kids ages and it's near empty, which is so pleasant!! Probably because it's further away, but it's far preferable to the madness of the sports cafe or hucks! We wished we'd gone here on Friday instead of hucks. Ok so winter wonderland, it's nice, lots of extra touches. You can complete a winter trail for free, and kids get a chocolate maltesers Santa. Mini (tiny) chocolate Santas for kids on check in. Singing reindeers which kids loved! Lights everywhere so at night it's lovely. You can write a letter to Santa and get a reply. It's personalised. All included. Ours never arrived but guest services arranged for us to pick it up. Activities - we did more activities this time then ever before. It's hard when it's cold as can't just go to the playground. Pottery painting was a huge surprise, we made decorations for the Christmas tree. With booking fee it worked out at about ¬£17 a decoration, but it's honestly worth it! They are amazing! Kids entertained and took approx 1.5 hours. You collect it the next day. My 2 year old needed a lot of help but was still worth it. We did pony trekking which mine loved but the lady running it was slightly angry and strict with the rules, my son wasn't allowed to stroke the pony at all and had to keep his hands firmly on the handles! He's ridden a few times but was absolutely not allowed to let go no matter what, insurance rules I am guessing!! Was still fun though. Football pool is only ¬£10 but a waste of time! Kicking a ball around a small pool table. Ok for half an hour if desperate and it's raining!! We visited Santa which was just delightful. No crowds, lovely walk leading up to it, and nice presents. We were talking to him for a good ten mins, no rush at all, my 4 year old honestly thinks he's met the real thing. And you get 2 photos included too. It's good value for money as costs same as our local garden centre and was a hundred times better! We also did the elf hunt which was about ¬£5 a child. Again worth doing, you just follow an elf with a bag and collect tokens, at the end you go to the hut at adventure of the senses and the kids get a small pack of haribo and a toy for the tree! Lovely. Lasts about 15-20 mins. Overall we were impressed with the activities and we didn't find them overly expensive for what we got. We live in London and the prices were comparable. Swimming pool - we found it far emptier then usual! Maybe as we normally go mid week so it's full of families but this time was not so busy, no queues for slides, only bit that seemed busy was the Rapids. The only disappointment was that they have stopped letting adults go down the kids slides in venture bay. Which is fine if you have 4 year olds who will go alone although I imagine some 4 year olds would hesitate. Not so great for 2-3 year olds who perhaps don't want to go down alone until they've had a go with you first. Entering into a tunnel you've no idea what's at the end, and as a parent you've no idea if your child will cope or not if they are younger. Plus in our previous 2 visits we were allowed to take our kids on the slides, so why change the rules! Rules for rules sake ruining the enjoyment and making that area not suitable for ages 2-3! We were directed to a tiny baby slide as being the only one suitable for our daughter if we couldn't go down with her! Not good at all. Luckily my 4 year old took my daughter down and solved the issue in the end, but why no adults all of a sudden??! So overall a good visit, winter wonderland was nice but not outstanding, however the activities were lovely if you're really into Christmas!! Unfortunately this is probably our last visit due to being restricted to school holidays now, but we really enjoyed ourselves and will continue to recommend to friends!

Every member of staff we spoke to was polite, helpful and friendly.We reported a couple of minor maintenance issues with the villa (not the sort of thing that would be picked up by housekeeping) and they were resolved very quickly indeed. The only issue I had with the villa itself was the heating control which seemed to set itself to random temperatures at random times of the day. that and the mattress was too firm for my liking (but that is a preference thing).As for the activities, we spent hours each day in the pool and enjoyed walking round the park itself as well as letting our little one run riot in the outdoor play areas. Yes the activities are quite expensive but worth the money. Our little one did an Elf Hunt, Balance Bike Academy, Elf Academy and went to see Father Christmas. She loved them all and that made it worth the money. Had the weather been nicer we would have spent more time outside exploring and den building.The fireworks by the lake mid-week were amazing too.We had a lodge in Pine which is on the outer ring on the West side of the park. A great location as it is off the 'main road' through the park so on arrivals and departures day you only got traffic for the lodges in the area and not all the through traffic.

The access arrangements described to me prior to booking did not exist and I believe this particular park was in breach of disability rights. We had no support or assistance and while I accept that the dome which is the busiest facility maybe not where many customers with wheelchairs may want to go the fact is there should be a choice. My mum 89 was looking forward to watching her great grandchildren in the pool. We had planned and researched and from the information I got this wasn't going to be a problem. It really was and I have told guest services, made a formal complaint and will be contacting disability rights.We also had issues with the mobility transport. I suspect and I hope I am wrong that centre Parcs talks the talk about disability but I don't feel more vulnerable customers are at the heart of their operations. I can't understand why when they promote themselves as family orientated and my mum at 89 is an important part of our family but unable to participate not due to us but down to lack of insight and care of centre Parcs.I was told things would be better after the refurbishment but that doesn't help us.Our accommodation an executive lodge was old, tired and dirty.

No point in going into the many brilliant activities available, other than to say book early to avoid disappointment, ensure you arrive on time and be prepared to spend - they have a captured audience.  However, all great fun, definitely worth getting bikes too if nothing else.  A lot of the accommodation seems to have dated since Elveden first opened and looks a little prefab from the outside (although they do seem to be squeezing  some additional new accommodation onto the site).  However inside is modern and immaculate and I'd much prefer to have substance over style. In fact even though we were in the minority of not having children with us we did have a ball.  I would say, on the whole, our biggest complaint was the offer of overpriced, underwhelming restaurants and very basic food which they still failed to get right.   Just for example ('cause the others were equally as bad) the staff were pleasant enough at the Cafe Rouge (one of the 4 restaurants visited over the weekend) we couldn't get a table on line until 3.15 for our Sunday lunch and yet when we turned up the place was empty and the guys disappointed as they had run out of 'Sunday Lunch'.  The escargots were covered with mushrooms(!), deep fried camembert with copious amounts of breadcrumbs and little cheese served with a very runny and tasteless 'Cranberry and Redcurrant sauce', the moules marinere consisted of the smallest mussels (more cockles!) I have ever encountered with yet another watery sauce, not the white wine &amp; shallot sauce promised, and let's face it for a French restaurant that is pretty dismal.

Eco aware should read economy facilities at inflated prices for basic woodland lodges. I'm sick of the weak power in the showers. Anyone can buy a special head to save water. The water pressure here is ridiculously low. Anyone with hair will struggle to wash and rinse effectively. The sofas etc are way overdue to be replaced and very uncomfortable. An air of dated and worn out. Shabby not chic. As usual the drinks here are ridiculously expensive as is eating out. I've just had enough of this overinflated pricing and underwhelming experience. It's not value for money at all. The accommodation is way overpriced as is the dining and drinks. There is always a fault or something missing at the villa. How on earth an updated villa can be worth an extra charge is beyond me. This should be part of a regular maintenance program. Never any personal recognition of being a returning customer or welcoming touch. I'm here now and will definitely not be back.  More fool me for returning so much before.

The handbook asks you not to let your children play in the woods!!! My grandchildren enjoyed being able to cycle around safely and loved all the outdoor playgrounds of which there is a good variety. Disappointing is the lack of commitment to the environment. Yes they are growing trees and there is a nature centre but no solar power or wind power and nowhere to recycle food waste.  If you want to build A den you will have to pay for the privilege. If it's raining all indoor activities so expensive. ¬£26 for 45 mins bowling for 2 adults and 2 children. The children's disco every night is so American with sexist videos on screens that the children were glued to. Not much opportunity for healthy eating. We were lucky with the weather.

groupe_11,"Our group had four two-bed lodges in a row (ours was 752) and every one came with issues. Ours was typical: bit tatty, drab and not that clean, peeling wallpaper, a broken oven, chipped surfaces, broken windows catches. One of our group didn't even have bedsheets on the first night. Granted our previous stay was at the much newer Woburn, but the lodges here seem really poorly maintained and presented, regardless of their age. A ¬£50 Premier Inn room puts them to shame.The kids classes were very expensive for what they were; the ¬£15 science class involved sticking tissue paper to card and pouring coke into a bottle and watch it froth over. Cake and Christmas stocking making were of average value, pottery was good but eye-wateringly expensive by the time you've paid for everything.Foodwise, fair to middling. Bella Italia was what you'd expect and not too over-priced, Cafe Rouge expensive with the most overcooked tuna I've ever seen, but the Indian place was very respectable. The main sports bar shut just after 10 because there 'wasn't enough people to justify keeping it open'. Fair enough, the whole place is a ghost town by 10pm, but for the money we were paying I'd expect the bar to stay with us until at least normal pub times. It was a shade under six quid a pint too.Queues in and out were really long, while directions - as others have mentioned - are very poor, particularly at night. Redeeming features? The swimming pool is good as is the friendliness of all the staff we met. Unfailing warm and courteous across the park.In my eyes, the only thing Elveden had in common with five stars is the price. At a sliver under ¬£800 for three nights - and with everything an extra cost bar swimming - it's ridiculously over-priced for what it is.

We booked a mid-week stay in a two bedroom lodge (Birch area - 5/10 min walk to the main area). It was clean, spacious and well designed. I had seen reviews about worn down cabins, which am sure there are, however ours was fine. The main bathroom was a little worn but I wasn't expecting a brand new everything and we experienced no problems when we were there. It is also worth mentioned that all lodges come complete with the travel cot and high chair if you have young ones, which is very handy. These are easy to assemble and kept out of site in the store/boiler cupboard in the lodge. The beds are comfortable and you have a nice patio with BBQ area out the back to take advantage of if the weather works in your favour.The site itself is well designed, lots of space so it doesn't seem as busy even if the car park appears full. The whole site is car-free, for obvious reasons. Our experience of getting in the park was a little stressful. We arrived at 2pm but didn't realise you aren't allowed access to the park until 3pm unless you've paid for early access, which i didn't know about until i got there. We went with our 10 month old baby who loved the softplay area and the main pool. We also managed a few of the rides (not with the baby) which were a lot of fun. We found the amenities great, always lots to see and do, even with a 10 month old.As for the restaurants, we mainly dined in (do a food shop beforehand otherwise you'll pay over the odds at their own supermarket) but did experience Hucks BBQ, which was nice and the portions were a pleasant surprise too.

Our accommodation this time was a (recently refurbed) executive lodge inCedar, and while it was comfortable enough it was really quite small; on first arriving it looked as if the door was the entrance to a shed, as there was no front window. Some of the areas we remembered from previous visits have changed beyond recognition; the former golf driving range has been used for new lodges and as previous reviews have mentioned, the trees will take 15-20 years to become mature.  The lodges there are huge (bigger than my house) and the impression is of a newly-built housing estate in suburban California, with associated parking lots alongside. There are also some huge tree-top lodges in the area of the nature trail. There are now nearly 900 lodges/villas on this site, but no increase in facilities.  There is a lot of building going on to expand the sub-tropical swimming paradise (although it was far from sub-tropical at times, other reviews have mentioned a glitch with the heating) and while it doesn't intrude much on the visitors there was (perhaps unsurprisingly) no mention of this building work which is scheduled to continue into 2019 in the welcome letter .  I also recall that the changing rooms for the pool (no increase in capacity here either, despite the increase in visitor numbers) used to have a heated floor, but that is no longer the case, with resulting cold feet!  Center Parcs has upped its game in some respects, especially in the area of removing money from visitors (¬£45 to specify which area you want your accommodation to be in, and another ¬£40 or so for early vehicle access), but is it really necessary to have 4 Starbucks on the site, and so many arcade games in the Jardin Des Sports?  I couldn't see much use for the wristwatch/sunglasses retail outlet either.  The only dining out we had was at Cafe Rouge, which was good quality and a reasonable cost, with good service.  Without wishing to sound like a grumpy old bloke (which I might well be!) I rather think that Center Parcs has lost its way from the original philosophy of decent standard accommodation and plenty to entice you out into the fresh air. Other reviews have mentioned the default heating setting for the accommodation at 14C, too low during the coldest week of the year so far, but the heating worked well.

Accommodation clean but when we arrived there was an awful stagnant smell. Thought it was the lake till I stuck my nose in the kitchen sink - yuck. Called guest services and they sent maintenance out. Said it was the overflow so they unscrewed the U bend and emptied/cleaned it. Later that night the smell was still there (very unpleasant :( ). The cleaning team came and cleaned the sink and put some cleaner down the plug hole. in fact we had the cleaners visit us 4 times over the weekend which has never happened before putting lots of bleach/disinfectant down the plug hole. We unscrewed the plughole to find a disintegrated seal, loads of hair and possibly fat sitting at the bottom. Really hope they take the sink apart before someone else checks in!

I booked here mainly for the magic show but didn't realise it was aimed at younger children. I thought it was an adult magic show. So we left not long after it started as my teenagers and 7 yr old weren't thrilled with it. Thankfully weren't heckled as we snuck out!Swimming - we all loved the swimming and rapids and slides. Can never fault the pool as its great fun for all the family.Yoga - I did Yoga on Saturday morning but was so disappointed. I've done pilates before but not yoga (except from YouTube videos!) so was looking forward to it. But I think we did just 1 pose. It was lots of stretching whilst laying on the floor.

There we were told no its a weekend rate as 24 hours is 9am Sunday morning. Annoying as we could've just hired from Friday if we'd known. Was ¬£136 for bikes for us all for 2 days. My daughter loved the tag along as this has helped with her confidence on a bikeWe are heading back with the extended family in February and like always look forward to it. We were unlucky with our lodge as hasn't happened before.

groupe_11,"We stayed for a 4 night break in the pine area 2 bed executive lodge. I had read a lot of reviews and was a bit worried beforehand about the standard of accommodation but we were very happy with our lodge. We were a family of three.  Two adults and a two year old. I had stayed at sherwood once before about 15 years ago but had not much memory of the place. Our verdict...we loved it. Absolutely loved the wildlife and the lodge. We thought the daily housekeeping service made our holiday and was well worth it. Our son enjoyed roaming safely and freely about and we were very happy to have 4 days of a slower pace. We swam twice and found the pool and water very cold.  I have since found out that there was a technical problem that week causing the temperature to be lower than usual.   I checked that out before rebooking as it really was very cold.  The changing rooms were okay except I do remember in the past they used to have underfloor heating which kept everywhere warm and dry.   What has happened to this I wonder?  We liked the fact that the pool opened a bit earlier for under threes but found it a little strange that the children couldn't  go and use any of the toddler areas during this time. It was just a sing song in the main pool. We ate out at bella Italia one evening and found the service to be good but the quality of food poor and the cost exorbitant.  We also used the dine in option which was also a bit expensive but we were happy to pay for this as the quality of the food was excellent and the delivery was right on time.We didn't book our son in for many activities as we didn't think he would really enjoy them and they were quite expensive.   We did however book the 30 minute photo shoot with Pret a portrait.  We thought this was absolutely fantastic and couldn't rate the experience highly enough.  Sophie the photographer was extremely professional and very friendly with an absolutely fantastic manner with toddlers.  We had a lovely time with her and the photographs she took were so lovely they made me cry.  Yes they are expensive to purchase but you do get an included framed photograph for your ¬£20  they are not as expensive as some photographers I have seen. We enjoyed our week so much we have booked again for next year.  That said we would only consider coming during term time and not peak season as we could never afford the cost otherwise.   I think if we had paid ¬£1000 for our experience we might have felt differently but we found our week to be brilliant value for money and one of the best holidays with a young child we have ever had. Highlights were definitely Louise who cleaned our lodge every day,  The fantastic wildlife and setting of our lodge, the photography shoot  and the layout of the lodge was fantastic with the porch area for coats and shoes etc.  We thought the beds were extremely comfortable and the bedding was lovely. A few snags that stopped our rating being five star were  The heating in our lodge was set to default of 14u00b0 which was just not warm enough during the coldest week of the year so far.  This meant we had to keep turning it up and keeping an eye on it and every time we went out it went back down again.   Our safe was locked and when we asked how to get it unlocked we were told by Louise to contact security.  She helpfully provided the phone number to ring which we tried to do on many occasions but they just never answered the phone.   We thought the TV was a bit ancient and small but to be honest  that was not a big problem.   My biggest gripe and I have to admit the only real problem of the holiday was a lack of washing machine in our lodge.  It is the only place we have stayed in recent years of this standard that did not have a washing machine and I have to admit with a toddler and three lots of swimming things daily  it was a pain to not be able to wash.  However I could not really see where a washing machine could have fitted in the kitchen area.  I did hear from another family staying they had heard a service wash was available but we had not seen any information about this.   On our last day we did realise that some pages were missing from the information book in our lodge so maybe it was there.  My husband and I found all the staff that we met to be very friendly and helpful and the guys driving tractors and diggers etc always waved at my little boy which he enjoyed.  We have some treasured memories of our week including our son feeding the squirrels and collecting pinecones in his bucket.  We did not feel that we had to spend a lot of money to have a brilliant week.  Thank you to everyone at Center Parcs but especially Louise who made a holiday fantastic    It was so nice to come back to the lodge every afternoon having had it cleaned.  We are already looking forward to coming back next year.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0
groupe_11,My daughter stayed at elves in forest recently not for the first time. And like times In the past invited me there for the day. In the past it's cost just over a tenner for a day pass. Which I've always thought that's ok. This year the price has shot up to 35 pounds. Which is ridiculous as once inside you spend a small fortune just under 200 quid for 7 burgers 7 drinks and 2 starters. That's daylight robbery. The only thing free is swimming.  Yes it's a peaceful place but for how much you would end up spending I'm not sure I would book a holiday here.

groupe_11,"Left rather disappointed after our latest visit to Centre Parcs.. as a frequent visitor to Elvedon Forest, once or twice a year, myself and my mother in law was looking forward to recovering from our own medical treatments- myself an unsuccessful round of IVF treatment and my mother in law a very bad bout of Polymyalgia, so a nice relaxing visit to the Aqua Sana spa was just what we needed, knowing how lovely and reviving our previous sessions in the spa had been. So we booked into the spa on the Saturday during our stay (11th November). This was by far the worst experience both of us had experienced at the spa. Firstly the number of guests in the spa was overloaded as we struggled to find an empty locker each, as we entered the main spa area it was clear to see we wasn't going to have the peaceful experience we both expected and needed, there seemed to be several groups of women talking extremely loudly not only in the spa but also having loud conversations wishing the steam room, this happened three times whilst myself and my mother in law were trying to relax in the steam room to which we ended up exiting the particular steam room. We went up to the 'quiet area' but this was to no avail again as there seemed to be another group of loud women taken over the water beds and sofa bed area. I over heard a couple of staff members on two occasions ask the group of guests to 'please keep their noise down as people are trying to relax' this fell upon deaf ears.We both felt utterly disappointed that we had each paid ¬£44 to use, what we thought would be, the nice relaxing spa to help ease our state.

groupe_11,"We stayed here on the 5th -9th Feb in a 1 bed executive lodge in Oak area. We booked a late minute deal. We had stayed in the same section of lodges in a previous visit so knew the lodge was very near the square so didn't pay the extra to pick your lodge. On entrance to the lodge we was on the end of block of lodges the inside was the usual of the executive lodge all mod cons, coffee maker, dishwasher etc. Small table with 2 chairs. The outside area was slightly disappointing as the was a big banking of soil which looked like this was from digging out for the lodge on building it. So we had no grass area or much view only looking up into the trees in the distance. We got a very small patio and chairs plus bbq. We had stayed in a 1 bed executive before further up in this area and had slot more out door space. But this is the luck of the draw. As usual in the 1 bed you don't get much clothes space or much space at all for clothes or luggage etc. Very small bathroom. We had to leave some of our clothes in suitcase. And leave suitcase in the doorway. It you don't go to stay in your lodge. We only tried the pool once as the water was cold but it is lovely and had spent many hours in there on previous visits. But was very cold on this visit in the water. They are building a new children's part which is due for completion in 2019. We did eat on at Jardin spirts hall which is good value and nice food. Foresters inn which wasn't that good food on this stay, cold burger and greasy food. Cafe rouge expensive not good value. Starbooks 2 hot chocolates with cream ¬£6.50 for 2, but we did go in twice to warm up with a hot drink. Used the parc shop as they bake lovely cakes sausage etc. Plus purchased some duck/swan food as we had visitors  very day. They have built new lodges in a year since our last visit which now take over the golf range up near the country club. There is lovely walks round the lake and other park areas. Few niggles- dirty plates and cups in our lodge which we had to put in the dishwasher before we could use them. Had to dive out of the way of people speeding round on bikes( yes it is centre Parcs but slow down as there was children diving out of the way to.) pool water could do with heating more it was very cold. Improve food in some eating areas. Pluses- great stay with families and couples, lovely walks, activities if you want them. Lodges- we've stayed in 4 bed games lodge in Pine which are fab hot tub etc. 1 bed executive in Oak nice for couples all mod cons but are very small inside. If your budget stretches the new built lodges up in pine look fab. 3 bed I believe. Take plenty of cash if you have 10yr olds plus as the activities are not cheap. Free WiFi in lodges  which was very good in our area in Oak on this visit. Would be good if 1 or 2 bed llodges could be built with hot tubs, as you need to pay a lot more to get one as they only come with new 3 bed plus lodges. Overall we had a lovely stay few little niggles. We always like centre Parcs but it is expensive to stay. Maybe on our next visit we will try another centre Parcs as we've been here many times over the years. Give Sherwood a go but take plenty of cash if your a family.

In general the lodge was good, the beds were comfortable and clean but a considerable amount of either mould or thick dirt on the skirting boards and window frames which would benefit from some cleaning or replacing. The swimming pool changing rooms smelt strongly of urine but there were used nappies left around, the mixed changing rooms not great either and not enough cubicles for the demand. As swimming is the only free activity it seems full at all times and would be better if it was monitored at times to improve the quality. The bowling was good value.

groupe_11,"Stayed in a newly built 3 bed executive lodge at the end of January. Lodge was disappointing; on arrival cupboard door was hanging off and fridge door handle fell off. Reported this immediately and was fixed a couple of hours later. Lodge wasn't very clean, had yoghurt smeared on dining table chairs, hairs and squashed dead insects on bathroom door, kitchen worktop had bits of food stuck on. We cleaned this up ourselves rather than calling someone again as wanted to get on with our evening. When putting my daughter to bed discovered that the bedroom door was catching badly on the top and made an awful loud noise when you tried to close or open it. There was a crack in the wood where it was catching. Reported this the next morning and it was fixed sometime in the afternoon. Nothing in the lodge seemed to have been done to a particularly high quality, for example the sofa was uncomfortable and lightweight, kitchen units not great. The sliding door to the patio stuck really badly to the point that I could not shut it myself, the sauna door glass had been smashed and taped up (it became apparent that this was probably because the sauna door would not stay shut in the wind). Given that these lodges were newly built and only been in use since around November, I was expecting more. It seemed like the lodge had been built and furnished, then no one had ever bothered to check anything again! Space in the lodge was poor also, there is a much better lay out in the old style lodges. I felt as though I was squeezing around everywhere, no room around the table for example. We used the cot that was supplied by CP, it would not fit in the bedroom (room with bath)! We had to swap rooms with our friends who also had a baby but had brought a smaller travel cot.I know crunchy bed linen has been mentioned before but dear god it was a nightmare! The noise was like we were climbing in to crisp packets! We spent the nights trying not to move to avoid waking the baby. I'm not sure if it's because it's cheap bedlinen or its been starched to death, or both. Bizarre.Center Parcs isn't exactly inexpensive, and I wouldn't mind this if it was worth it when you get there....but it's really not! More accommodation being built all the time with no further facilities. The only change I could see is more seating in eating areas, but this is to the detriment of other things, eg. more tables in Foresters in place of pool tables, it used to feel like a nice pub/restaurant where you could have a relaxed drink whereas now it just feels hectic. The park in general is a bit tired. Yes work is being done on the pool, but there seemed to be things that had just been left broken, parts of the children's parks for example.The new lodge we stayed in hadn't any trees or wildlife around it, trees have been planted but it is currently just a muddy mess. I appreciate forests don't just appear overnight, but there is now a large chunk of the park that is like this, and will be for a good few years.Maybe there's a masterplan that will all come together in a few years, but at the moment, and based on staying in a newly built lodge, it's not somewhere I would return to or recommend.",1.0,-1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0
groupe_11,"We normally visit CP Elveden and have never had any problems. we decided to go to Sherwood this time, but NEVER AGAIN. Upon arrival the lodge (270) was freezing, the boiler was not working so no hot water or heating. Engineer attended within an hour, however was unable to fix so had to go away to get a new part. Returned a little later and fixed. But then discovered that the Extractor fan in the toilet was not working. Was never repaired. Went to use the oven and it would not light nor would the grill. Whilst engineer was at lodge fixing boiler, asked him to look at the oven. He said seal was also broken, couldn't fix/light so advised would need to be replaced. This was done the next day. So had to wait in again (as we had a dog with us). Went to use the shower, but bath kept filling up as waste was coming up out of the plug hole and then taking up to 20 minutes to empty. When maintenance man arrived he cleared eventually with a plunger, but in his words said &quot;it was like a whole dog being down there!&quot;. He also replaced the oven,Cupboard door hinges were not secured properly so had to fix hinge. Fridge door would not close properly as door hinge had dropped. In order to shut door had to be lifted and closed at same time.In one of the rooms only 1 bed had bed sheets and these were stained/dirty. Guest services did respond when told, but effectively we lost 2 of our 4 days by waiting in for maintenance men. In my opinion this villa was not worth the ¬£749 paid for weekend. Very poor standard, almost as if it was waiting to be refurbished. Should not have cost that much. Were provided with some gift vouchers to use due to inconvenience, but doesn't make up for the lost days.Hucks diner looked as if recently refurbished and looked good, however the food was well below standards expected. Mac n Cheese was extremely poor. Had better from a packet!! Certainly not worth the ¬£13 charged!Dining in was excellent especially the Thai Green Curry and Teriyaki Salmon &amp; Udon noodles, although a little expensive.

This was the first time we have visited during this period and it was truly magical with the twinkly lights and Christmas atmosphere.We have been going to centre parcs for many years and Elveden has really upped its game.  The villas have been refurbished to a high standard and are very comfortable.  My only slight issue this time was the gas oven/grill was a bit tricky to operate.  It cooked but it would have struggled with a Xmas turkey..We cooked in the villa most of the break but had a lovely Sunday lunch in Cafe Rouge which we had pre booked.  It was expensive however it wasn't extortionate - I'd say London prices which we are used to.  And let's face it, centre parcs IS expensive.  You've already melted your plastic to actually book the short break so the prices in the village should not be a shock..  I'd say avoid the supermarket in the village and come prepared.  Order an online shop the night before and bring it with you. This really keeps the costs down (and my stress levels!) Also restaurants get booked up.  Really booked.  You can't be spontaneous particularly if you have youngsters.  Book your restaurants before you go if you plan to eat out.A nice touch was the firework display which happens once each break during winter wonderland.  We were really impressed with it - at least a couple of grands worth of gunpowder going up.  Oh and a little surprise at the end.....I only give 4 stars because it is expensive.

What I can say is the food and drink on offer is a high standard so I don't mind paying prices for this however ¬£11 for a glass of wine and pint of beer is what I would expect to pay in London not thetford. And the activities are extortionate considering you can go other places and they are included in the price I'm not sure how they justify their prices I'm sure there would be a reason but even upping the price of the break by ¬£50 for every family and saying you can choose any activity/s up to this price and they will book it for you would be a massive help.

These are beautiful and although small contain everything which you need to enjoy your stay.  However, we had to queue for nearly an hour to get into the parc, this is just stupid when your asked to check in on line and you just need to collect your key CP you really need to look at this process and speed it up. CP you also need to rethink your facilities, and how they cater for the people staying a the parc. We paid for 3 hours in the spa on saturday afternoon - in the ladies changing room it was hard to find a vacant locker it was absorlutely packed. Once in the spa it was difficult to find room in the actual saunas and when you did find space, people were constantly opening the door to see if there was availible room so letting out all the heat.The thermal pool kept stopping for several minutes every so often, not great if you've just managed to grab a space in one of the jaccuzi spots, and the water was definitely on the chilli side (we found this also in the swimming pool ) so think money is being saved by turning down temperatures in these places. The food we had in the sports bar was very good IF you could find a clean table, being so packed the staff (who are very hard working ) obviously struggle to clear and clean the tables whilst taking orders and delivering food and drink. There are lots of new chalets and another new appartment block being built where the old hotel previously stood. This is on top of the new super duper chalets and tree houses which have been built recently, are attacting more and more people which is great. BUT CP you need to start looking at expanding your indoor sports and spar facilities to accommodate all these people.

groupe_11,"So this was the second trip we've made to Center Parcs - the last time we came was before we had children and we were staying with friends for a birthday in an executive lodge. The problem is my husband and I are both teachers and have no choice but to come when it's school holidays and pay the massively expensive price increase. So we booked a three bedroom woodland lodge for us, our 19 month old daughter and my parents. We booked one of the Oak lodges close to the village which was a brilliant idea as it was freezing cold so not too far to walk from the pool back to the warmth! However the lodge itself was dirty when we arrived. Quite clearly it hadn't been thoroughly cleaned and I'm not one to complain- I've only ever given five star reviews on trip advisor but I can't do that here. We paid ¬£800 for the weekend- that's a hell of a lot of money for three nights. The bathroom floor had hairs along the floor by the wall. The sink was a bit dirty and the bath had a non slip bit that had been painted with something that was peeling off so my daughter came out of the bath each night with bits of it in her hair- gross! The high chair we found in the porch cupboard had food stuck all over it- I had to scrub it thoroughly before we used it. The same bits of food were stuck to the edges of the table too. My daughter had dropped some food on the floor on the first night so my mum wiped it with a cloth and the cloth came up black with dirt off the floor. There was a large cobweb hanging from the bathroom ceiling too. Even in cheap hotels we've stayed in I've never seen such dirt left behind. Quite clearly the poor cleaner probably hasn't got enough time to do a proper job - I can imagine they are overworked! About time they employed more cleaners and invested in them rather ran upgrading the pool etc! I don't remember the executive lodge being as gross so maybe they spend less time on cheaper accommodation? But at ¬£800 we were left a bit miffed. Aside from the housekeeping issue we did have a lovely time mostly in the pool and as a family. We didn't pay to do any more activities as it had already cost us enough and the price of the activities put us off. We had one meal out- Bella Italia and it was fantastic- really delicious food- highly recommend. If Center Parcs are going to continue charging astronomical prices they had better invest in the basic cleanliness and housekeeping as they seriously let themselves down and I'm not sure we'd come again!

groupe_11,"We have been going to centre parcs for a very long time and love it here, it's only  half an hour from where we live so convenient as well. However it has to be said that it is starting to get prohibitivly expensive. Both for the villas you stay in and for the activities and food on site. The only free thing is the subtropical swimming dome. While that is great there is only so much time you can spend in there. There is also a substantial amount of building going on there as new rides are being built. They are doing this without much disruption at all to be fair, but it won't be finished until midway in 2019. I looked at booking a villa for next year, decided on the dates and by the time I had asked  everyone if those dates were ok and gone back to book, the price has gone up over ¬£200. This was literally the next day. So be very careful if you decide to book. Tbh I think a ¬£200 increase a  year is way over the top. I suppose it depends what you want from a short break in this country. There are so many activities, both indoor and outdoor, you won't have time to do them all. There are numerous restaurants offering a variety of cuisine, no Wowcher or any other vouchers can be used in center parcs tho so you will pay top price. To give you an example on our last day we went to the sports cafe for breakfast, there were 6 adults and 3 kids. We ordered 4 English breakfasts, 1 vegan breakfast,1 avocado on toast and drinks for everyone. The English breakfast consisted of 1sausage,1 rather of bacon, I spoon of beans, 1 egg, 1 small tomato and 1, yes 1, mushroom, a small slice of toast and butter. The bill was just under ¬£90.

This year started well as we turned up early and didn't have to queue for over an hour and managed to find a parking space without doing as many laps of the car park. We went straight to the country club for lunch where I'm convinced the prices had even increased since last year. 5 drinks (none alcoholic) and 3 lunches (two of which were soup) set us back ¬£65 and we'd only been there an hour. Anyway... we weren't sat in a queue with a crying toddler so I can't moan too much. Our villa was lovely, really pleased with the location I'd chosen and we found a sauna. We used the takeaway service which was great. Pizzas and wedges meal deal delivered to the door. Balance bikes was great for little ones.Father Christmas is still really magical, only problem this year was trying to keep a two year old waiting in a queue of 20 people despite having a time slot of 5 minutes. Fireworks were fabulous after our meal in Hucks (again, food prices are astronomical).Sports cafe was our best option with a toddler but when you pay ¬£14 for scampi and chips, you expect a good portion... it wasn't.Park market is well stocked but double normal supermarket prices... at least.   We will be bringing more food and drink if we come again, or visiting a local supermarket off site. Now swimming was great (not the children's pool area, it's noisy and chaotic and too many slips) but the rest of the pool was fine. Considering it's the only free activity, it was something we hoped to do each day..... no such luck :-( our two year old was struck down with violent vomiting in the middle of the night. It then continued every half an hour until he couldn't cope (washing machine and more clothes needed) My parents packed their things and took him home, we followed an hour later. Our holiday was cut short and I cried. I have emailed Center Parcs asking about the the lack of hand sanitizer stations (especially near toilets and restaurants). These were everywhere at Butlins and in our Spanish hotel. There were so many children coughing and wiping their noses in the play areas etc, it's just a disaster waiting to happen. We hoped to book for next year with the come back soon incentive, but losing 48 hours of a 5 day holiday has really put me off. We had activities booked in and couldn't do them which has really left the magic behind.  Car parking needs sorting!!! Please Center Parcs. It's been three years and each year we've been driving around that car park looking for ANY space. I don't care how far I've got to walk, I just want to park and start my holiday.

groupe_11,"Visited Mon-Fri with my partner, our 4 and 6 year olds. I think it was the first week of winter wonderland. As usual the part was decorated and very festive looking. Lots of artificial snow, fairy lights and displays such as the big festive arch, huge Christmas tree and giant singing reindeer. Huge hit with the kids and felt very much like it was Christmas. Activities we did:Santa's grotto. Most slots had been taken so we opted for one on the Monday evening. It was magical and although the kids were nervous they enjoyed it. They each received pretty decent presents worth at least ¬£5 each and a family photo each of us with Santa. They took quite a few and let us choose on a screen which ones we would like. Pottery:We booked the studio fee which was about ¬£5 each and arrived to a heaving studio. The tables were ridiculously close together and it was difficult concentrating with other people so close. All the different choices of things to paint are on shelves so you pick which ones you want and then pay for them at the counter. We chose a mermaid and gecko which were priced at around ¬£13 each. This was the cheapest available. Large choice of paints and tools on the tables and in draws by the counter. We then left our finished pieces to be collected the next day. Festive cupcake decorating:This was our favourite activity. The kids had four plain cupcakes each and were talked through in stages how to decorate them into Santa, penguin, snowman and a robin. It was a 45 minute session so we had to move quite quickly but at the end we had some beautiful cupcakes and were able to take any remaining icing back with us which the children used for their gingerbread house kits we had brought with us. There were only two other families in the session so it was quiet and we really enjoyed it. Quite pricey at ¬£11 each for the kids but they really did love it. Off road mini cars:Can't comment too much as my partner took our son but he came back happy and from the photos looks like he had a good time. He received a badge and certificate. The pool is the only thing free within the park so we visited each day. Absolutely packed in the day time but after 5pm it quietened down and was lovely. Lots to do and the kids really loved it. A few negatives:Lots of building works which there is no warning of prior to visiting. Huge orange fences and loud machinery. It wasn't a massive issue to us as our lodge was in a quite place but I can imagine it being unpleasant for some. Food prices are embarrassingly high. Absolutely ridiculous. We didn't eat out at all although we did get some drinks from star bucks which came to ¬£13 for two adult hot chocolates and two children ones. The parc market is about double the price of supermarkets outside so I definitely advise taking all your own food with you if you don't want to spend a fortune. In all, we love the park and what it has to offer but after the price of the lodge I think the cost of everything else is shocking. ",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0

If you want a drink or something to eat in the village square, you have no option other than to sit outside in the cold and wet or leave your dog in the villa.Why do Centre Parcs not appreciate that people who bring their dogs do so for a reason. There should at least be 'special areas' where dog owners can sit with their pets.Even an outside area with heating would have been welcomed, people were dressed in winter clothing, hats, gloves, scarves etc. we had no option other than to sit and shiver along with our dogs.Another issue I had with this location was the amount of work being undertaken, orange netting everywhere, construction plant in view and the sound of machinery echoing across the village. Not exactly the relaxing and peaceful week we were hoping for. We can't recall any prior warning about construction being undertaken on the website at the time of booking, it was a most unwelcome surprise!All in all a fairly poor week, not good value for money if you are a pet owner, particularly as you have to pay a (cleaning) surcharge to bring them.Doubt I'll be back unless things dramatically improve for pet owners.",0.0,,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,-1.0

The other frustration I had was the swimming changing rooms, we struggled to get a family one every time we went (every day for 4 days) so we were constantly cramped up in a tiny one which was just awful given there are 4 of us and I'm ready to pop.

groupe_11,"Second visit to Elveden, 5 years after the first. The park is a very pleasant place to spend time, and the lodges (provided you're in a refurbished one) well appointed, clean and comfortable. As always with Center Parcs the prices are high, not just staying in the first place but also eating/drinking when there and attending any of the activities. But provided your budget stretches worth the extra pennies.The kids area of the pool had been revamped since our last visit (a result of the fire perhaps), and whilst it is certainly full of slides and apparatus it perhaps lacked a slightly calmer more pool based area for smaller kids to splash about in. Additionally the lockers have all been replaced and are now access by a wrist band that doubles up as a door key - but each band can only operate one (small) locker. Can be a challenge when carting sufficient towels/clothing etc for a family - larger lockers and changing cubicles should be available. I was disappointed to arrive back at my lodge one lunchtime to find a couple of work men trying to access, apparently running &quot;electrical checks&quot;. I let them in but they proceeded to spend the next 30 mins in the relatively small space - awkward when a family of 4 wants lunch! I did mention this to Guest Services but got very little comment back.The onsite medical centre was visited due to a 3 year old with croup and I was very impressed by the service and attentiveness of the nurses on duty.We will be back again, the few grumbles we had didn't take away from the overall enjoyment of the place.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0

groupe_11,"To set the scene we have been going to Centre Parcs for over 20 years, we have decided that due to the pricing structure we are not returning next year.For example, the villa  prices are raised typically by 10% each year (I don't know anyone that gets kind of pay rise). Everything (apart from swimming) costs at Centre Parcs, with prices you would expect to pay in and around the London area. Eating out is incredibly expensive, a meal for 4 at a basic restaurant would easily cost ¬£90.00 . Even the sports bar is pricing itself out of sports fans attending  sports functions - ¬£5.35 for a pint of beer! I am sure the staff do not get paid London weighting so the outrageous prices must be for profit.They may say they use the profits for extra amenities but that would be very wrong, yes they keep digging up facilities to build more villas...so for paying lots of money you get more villas, therby more people but still the same parking spaces (chaotic to get parked) and the same size changing rooms at the pool, on Saturday afternoon it was chaos families queuing to get changed both in and out.

Accommodation was ok ..beds bathroom fridge kitchen all very clean . However as the baby was a lot of the time on a playmat on the floor I must say the cleaning of the floors were not good . Old dust and hairs etc on the rugs . The lodge was ok but in the past we have always been toasty warm but after the first night we woke in the middle of the night freezing.Baby was cold it disturbed everyone. We then set the thermostat to not drop below 19 degrees recommended for new borns ....again every time we went out and came back we had to override thermostat so we ended up letting her sleep in a hat . We left a message on the chalk board . It spoilt the stay . On a brighter note i must commend the staff in most locations and outlets ..All full of Christmas spirit and helpful .

Badminton was great fun in the central sports area and we spent a whole day in the water park on all the different slides and outside pool area. It did get quieter at the end of the day (5pm onwards) so I would recommend that time if you prefer less kids around. We took turns cooking / barbequing for the family so we did not eat at the restaurants unfortunately. We saw squirrels, muntjacs, loads of birds - it was lovely!Would definitely stay again, perfect for the young, old and everyone in between!",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

groupe_11,"After returning from a Friday-Monday stay wanted to comment on our experience. 3-5th November 20176 adults. On arrival our maple lodge 804 was tidy but not clean. There were numerous Halloween items clearly from previous visit scattered around villa, sweet wrappers, fake cobwebs, fake spiders. The lodge was supplied with only 1 toilet role which resembled sand paper. For 6 people this is not acceptable. Our toilet was broken, the oven was broken which was quickly fixed after talking to customer services.  Services were dusty, carpet was clearly not hoovered in between stays. Bed quality. A party of 6 are leaving with sore necks after terrible nights sleeps. It would be good if you could offer a hard and soft pillow option which would over come this problem. The swimming pool changing facilities are disgusting, floors were soiled with tampons and dirty nappys. The floor is covered in dirt and leaves and really make the entire experience far from Luxury after paying Luxury prices. The pool and selected slides was sadly shut for the duration when we went to the pool due to glass which was extremely disappointing and is the highlight of the holiday we look forward too. FoodWe went for lunch at dexters which was very disappointing. A stale burger bun, and average burger meat followed by a half full mug of chips and a flat coke. McDonalds food is better and more than half the price. The pancake houseDiabolical. Service was slow we stood waiting by the door for at least ten minutes and the reStaurant was not exactly full.The food was possibly the worst food we have ever been served. Sweet corn and chicken pancake was dry, tasteless, and actually the batter will still raw inside. We were so beyond fed up with food quality we left and paid very quickly. Extremely over priced for poor quality. Bella italiaWe were about to give up on food and then had a fantastic meal here on Saturday evening thanks to Caroline a very chatty, funny lady! She was kind and considerate and apologised for slow service and removed a starter of the bill and complimentary espresso. She really did make our experience very pleasant and the food was very good. One member of our party however ordered a Carbonara pizza which was stated new to the menu it couldn't of been further of a carbonara pizza after us all trying it. The pizza was dry, super spicy and none of ingredients resembled a carbonara. Members of our party had severe allergies and were very happy to be able to eat good fresh food. Curry houseService was fast and friendlyFood and was very good quality. FireworksThis was a very impressive fantastic firework display we were worried about the wildlife though after hearing they do fireworks twice a week at center parks during November and December months. Drink prices are extortionate. We paid ¬£20 for 2 slush puppies with double vodka shot. Speechless. We had lovely cycle rides through the forest and saw lots of wildlife, one of our favourite points is the wildlife hut near the Breckland appartments. We enjoyed Bella Italia and Indian, the rapids, the disco for adults was a laugh and feeding the ducks on the beach with bird seed.(¬£180 to hire 6 bikes for the 3 days)We do however feel disappointed at the food options this really is such an important part of any holiday we feel like we have been robbed.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0
groupe_11,"I booked Center Parcs because I wanted to bring my family (2adults, 1toddler) to Sherwood Forest. For the same price as a hotel (everybody sleeping in 1 room) we were able to book a mid week break in the cheapest 2 bedroom lodge. I intended this as just a place to sleep whilst we explored the area, after reading some negative reviews I became apprehensive that I had made the right decision!When we arrived (I won't lie, it's utter chaos as Monday is an everybody change over day!) we checked into our lodge in the cedar area. It was clean and spacious and well thought out, with a fireplace, a tv in the double bedroom and a chalkboard wall which our daughter made use of everyday! Yes there were things that could be modernised and maybe cleaned a little deeper but there must be hundreds of staff cleaning nearly 1000 cabins so it will never be perfect. By this I mean yes there were a few dirty marks on plates but they had clearly been through the dishwasher and as anybody with a dishwasher knows, they're not perfect! We did a shop at Tesco which is a 10 minute shop down the road. I recommend to do this on the way because once you've unloaded your car you have to park back in the car park so it can be quite a walk, especially with shopping bags! Again I was nervous about the pool with all the reviews I had read. We went to the pool around 5/6pm every evening, initially it was to tire the kid out before bed but we found it had other benefits too! There was always family changing rooms free, lockers are easily accessible and the kiddies play area was always relatively empty. Plus the nighttime lighting made it more magical and the outside pool more fun. I would never have attempted the pool in the day with a 2yr old but our routine worked perfect as she was asleep by the time we got back to the cabin every night! There are many people complaining on here about the pool needing updating and an increase in size but if you time it right it's not an issue and they are doing a massive upgrade/extension which will open next year.We ended up partaking in activities, me and my daughter did the pottery painting. The staff were so friendly and so helpful, I wanted to clean up after the carnage she had left but they wouldn't allow it. They wanted to do it and said we were on holiday and that we didn't need to clean up. My partner went to the spa, it's been newly renovated and he said it was very nice and relaxing. We tried several of the restaurants, the Jardin des sport was very expensive for a ropey old burger but they had a great soft play area. My favourite was the pancake house where again the customer service was excellent and the pancakes were to die for! Over all ended up having a really enjoyable and relaxing holiday, 1 day we didn't even leave the resort. We found it was the staff that made this break 5/5 as every single person we spoke with was kind friendly and willing to help, even the cleaners on leaving day said good morning. The whole resort is centred around children and it's the little touches such as steps at the sinks in every toilet for them to wash their hands or soft play in every restaurant to entertain them to make mealtimes that bit easier.I think if we had paid the nearly ¬£1000 for the same holiday in the summer then yes we would have been disappointed but for what we paid and the service we received, we will definitely be going again next year!!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Sherwood really is like living in the forest - where Whinfell feels a little manufactured in our view.Loved the village feel and no real central hub (ie covered) as it made us spend more time outside, and in the unexpected snow, it was lovely.Sadly, the service in the country club needs looking at, we had booked to eat at 17:30 and after an hour, was still waiting for mains. There was only a handful of people in the pub so we could only assume they had very few staff on to serve people - this was a really disappointing experience.The indian was superb in every way - highly recommend it.The pool was the main attraction for us and our little one loved the big slides as well as the kiddies area (which in our view is better than whinfell) - the outdoor part of the pool was brilliant and it was strange with snow falling. I agree with other reviews that the temperature in the changing rooms was unacceptable and at best &quot;cool&quot; which is not great when its minus 4 outside.

(11/12 u2013 15/12)Upon arrival everything seemed ok, but little by little it became clear that there were issues with the cleaning regime or lack of it.Initially like most people, we were not going to let the fact that the cleaners had failed to vacuum the bedrooms to a reasonable standard bother us. It seemed a little unreasonable to me that my daughter did not want to share her bedroom with the resident spiders who were residing in their spectacular cob webs, one in each corner. It must have seemed a shame to the cleaners to damage such a work of art!My wife then pointed out that the fire had not been cleaned out and that it still had the remains of a previous fire in it. In true holiday spirit, I explained that even though we had paid a hefty sum to stay in the accommodation, we were not beyond cleaning the fire out, these things happen, anyone can make a mistake or two.It then came time to cook our evening meal. With commendable persistence my wife battled to get the oven to light, I feel sure that this could become a new official Center Parcs activity in the future, such is the satisfaction felt by those who are successful.It then became apparent that the room was filling with smoke, we were all impressed with the smoke alarm and how loudly it sounded. Alas, no one came to check we were still alive or if we needed assistanceu2026..it appears that that the Customer Services team must be use to this kind of lame ploy to gain their attention.Once the smoke had dispersed, it could be clearly seen that the oven had an oily substance all over the bottom of it, and yes, this too had not been cleaned.I must admit that by this time even my holiday spirit was getting pushed to the limits.My daughter decided enough was enough and that she would phone the Customer Services department.Their initial response seemed encouraging, they said they would arrange for us to receive a ¬£40.00 credit for us to use at the 'Dining In' take away service as the house keeping would not be available for at least an hour and a half.I am not going to get distracted by discussing the inflated cost and mediocre quality of the meal here, that's a whole different subject, but as they say, it's the thought that counts.The next day after returning from the Rangers walk it was clear that the oven still had not been cleaned.Cue my daughter contacting Customer Services again. This time it was proving a little more difficult to get a firm commitment as to when the oven would be cleaned. My daughter requested to speak to the Manageru2026.they said they would get them to call her back, never happened.At 13:00 a lady came to the Lodge door and asked if we needed her services? I asked if she had been sent by the Customer Services department, but she knew nothing of our reports regarding the oven.I decided it was time for me to take a visit to the Customer Services team in the Sports Plaza to give them a little more detail as to how they were doing as a department.I gave a brief overview of the problems we had experienced regarding the poor standard of cleaning in the Lodge and the poor communication we had experienced from their department. I was immediately informed and reminded that they had very graciously provided us with ¬£40.00 credit to get our evening meal. This was said in such away that made you realise that this person had no idea of the price of the food on said menu and most certainly can't have tasted the quality of the food.I summarised the issues we had experienced regarding the poor standard of cleaning and lack of communication from their department and then waved a white flag and retreated, as it was clear that in her eyes I was just another complaining Customer.Later that afternoon we received a letter from the 'Guest Service' Shift Manager.

This letter was symptomatic of the whole shambolic experience.I have completed the Center Parcs 'Feed Back' survey and have ticked the box giving them permission to use my comments in any future advertising material, I somehow doubt they will, though I am hopeful that 'Oven Lighting' will make it onto the official activity list!Good Bye Centre Parcs, I'm done.",1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0
groupe_10,"Had a recent visit with my wife and two children. We all had a great time and the kids loved the winter wonderland themed decorations and activities. The accommodation (Oak - executive lodge) had plenty of room for the four of us but needed some cleaning and maintenance; single glazed and draughty windows, a shower which you literally had to run around under to get wet with and the rug and sofa should probably have been thrown on the fire if it weren't for the plaque stating only sanctioned and extortionately priced 'smokeless' Center Parcs logs could be used - bringing me on nicely to my next point. From the minute you arrive, you can't help but feel like you're being grabbed by the ankles and shaken for every penny you have, everywhere you go. Apart from the swimming, nothing is free and now they're even trying to extract cash from you while you're doing that. A shop, a cafe and a Starbucks around the pool, a theme park style photographer loitering intently while you swim with your family and a private hire teepee shack type thing with plastic chairs and a TV that you can rent out. The food at the restaurants is ok but again hugely overpriced for what you get and the takeaway (Dining In) was eye-wateringly expensive. For three curries, two rice, naan and bahji it was just over ¬£55 (and the curry was horrible). A kids cheese toasty in the sports bar was about ¬£7-8 and was literally just a toasty from your regular Argos sandwich toaster. The officially sanctioned 'crackle logs' for use in the open fire were close to ¬£5 (for reference, you can get a bag of 12 heat logs from Homebase for ¬£4). Having visited Center Parcs a few times before I knew to expect inflated prices for everything, but it feels like it's been pushed that much too far now and it detracts from the experience, which overall, was very good.The Elveden site also suffers from a lot of noise from the nearby airbases which perform various loud training exercise every day from around 8am to 7-8pm. Apparently this is mentioned in the small print of the terms and conditions but as part of the Center Parcs experience is meant to be relaxing in a peaceful and tranquil setting, they could be more upfront and honest about this.",1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0

Note to say it would be delivered by house keeper but didn't turn up. Contacted guest services at 9:30 once they eventually answered phone and it arrived 45 minutes later to be dumped in doorway by a rather grumpy member of staff and put it on ourselves. Villa not the cleanest and thankfully a vacuum is provided to give the floor a once overEven a contestant of the Krypton Factor would struggle to get the oven working and when it does eventually play ball it seems as soon as you open the door the smoke alarm goes offNot sure if checking crockery is part of house keeping duties but it was not cleanDrinks and food is very expensive and you don't get what you pay for. ¬£100 for four in Hucks Diner is not value for money when it is essentially a burger joint. Small portions served on a large tin lid. Music is very loud and lighting very bright - not a great atmosphereSmall point but Starbucks do not take their own gift cards - not sure why but expect a premium price on drinks. Prices are higher than London !!!!Looking for activities over weekend but again all seem incredibly high priced when you are looking to entertain a familyTV picture quality is poor and very limited number of channels. Must be a ploy to get you out of your villa to spend more moneyMy advice would be to take your own food and drink and bear with the oven or alternatively spend what is essentially a ¬£1000 for a family weekend break elsewhere,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0

groupe_10,"After visiting Sherwood 3 times in the last year we decided to chose a different village this time for our midweek break. Elveden is almost 5 hours drive for us but knowing we didn't then need the car once there, we didn't mind. Arrived around 1pm and had to queue to check in for half an hour. Not a great start, we have never once queued at Sherwood. We paid extra this time for a 'newly refreshed' lodge. Neither myself or my husband could see any difference at all other than a walk in the lounge area was a different colour. The sofas still looked old , along with stained carpets. Won't fall for that again! My husband laughed at me for taking antibacterial wipes but when I showed him the colour of one after I had wiped the kitchen worktop, he understood why I did! The levels of cleaning are poor. A quick flick around with a mop and a cloth does not count as cleaning Centreparcs. These villas should be deep cleaned regularly and they clearly are not. The village itself is well laid out and well maintained. Our 4 year old daughter did some fantastic activities: crazy science, princess party, adventure golf to name a few. All the staff were brilliant and the activities were well organised. Eating out was hit and miss. The Indian isn't a patch on Sherwood, but the dining In was very good. Hucks was still poor here, small portions for large prices. Plus, being pregnant, I really didn't appreciate the waitress coming up and putting both hands on my bump. Highly inappropriate and huge invasion of my personal space. Even my husband was shocked. Centreparcs is one of those holidays that each time I find things that really annoy me, but it's so amazing for kids, and to see how happy it makes my daughter is why we keep coming back. I now go expecting a less than clean villa etc, so I hope on our next trip that Centreparcs surprises me. I can live in hope!",1.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0

groupe_10,"I have just had a weekend at Centre Parcs Sherwood Forest and have come away not just disappointed but pretty angry. This was my first trip to a CP, but had always heard that they were pricey but fantastic. When we booked I had to double check the price, it was so high. I travel a lot both for business and pleasure, so when it comes to holidays, i always like to pay a little extra to make it feel special. So I thought to myself 'it will be worth it.' How wrong i was. Our accommodation that we paid so much for was pretty average. Log cabin type accommodation is popping up everywhere now, and this fell way below modern standards. It was also let down further by a strong smell of sewerage in the kitchen area and one of the bedrooms. The second huge bugbear for us was cars on site. It took us an hour from joining the queue to get in the gates to getting to our lodge. This made us late starting our plans so elected to leave our cars parked outside the lodge. Particularly as we were located in a quiet dead end corner at the opposite end of site to the car park. The next day we were left a note threatening us with removal from site if we didn't move our car to the car park. So we were forced to move our car to a full car park. This was challenging and dangerous in the middle of a busy Saturday afternoon. We then couldn't find a spot in the car park so had to park on a muddy verge. With the walk back to our lodge, this took almost another full hour out of our weekend. This was obviously repeated the following day retrieving our vehicle. We did the quad biking on the Sunday morning. This was the adult version, so for ¬£45 per person, was thoroughly underwhelming to just spend 30 minutes playing follow my leader at a snails pace. All other activities we tried to book, we decided against due to the exhorbitant price. This left us spending a lot of time in the grossly undersized pool area. Not nearly big enough for the ever expanding accommodation numbers. Finally the food. I was suprised and disappointed to find the site full of chain restaurants and cafes. We had dinner in a pub style restaurant. It was Wetherspoons quality with gastro pub prices! I won't visit a Centre Parcs again, as I could have a high end log cabin with a hot tub for less.

Our pine lodge was ok and we walked to the main office to get information about cycling outside CenterParcs . Unfortunately the elderly lady had no idea where we could go or any useful information. Walked back to our lodge which was clean and tidy a good start. By 11.00 pm cars were still parked and driving around the site and we had to jump out of the way into the wood so next morning we cycled past at least 45 cars still parked by 10.30 am that morning and discussed this with office staff and were told parking slips would be placed on their windscreens. So much for a car free environment.Then low loaders and highway lorries came in for the new hotel being built on site plus all the noise of a nail gun firing off during the day. This was then added by the fighter jets flying overhead form the local runways just down the road. So much for a quite peaceful tranquil forest well away from the city noise and pollution. The Corporate Company policy has pushed the prices very high in the restaurants and the bars to the point of really wanting to take the customer to the cleaners, even the so called supermarket prices are too high and if only everybody would boycott CenterParcs restaurants the management might eventually get the message.The next day we cycled around the park and got stuck behind lorries resurfacing the roads around the lodges with new tarmac. As I cycled past one of them my front wheel got caught in a cut out area and went straight over the handlebars with a forward roll onto the road in front. Lovely big bruises down my left leg and knee cap catching the tree logs beside the road. Perhaps it might have been my fault for not looking more carefully when cycling. Great start to the week there. My wife booked up in the middle of the week for the Aqua Sana at 12.30pm for a session but when she got there they had put down the wrong time for 1.30pm. Off to the cafe next door to wait. The lady at the entrance apologised and told her that she could come back for an extra session the next morning on the day we were leaving and put her name down. Nice touch CenterParcs.Went to give the lodge a cleanup with the nice newish looking blue Numatic vacuum cleaner and found the cotton Hepaflow bag full to the very top with ashes and dust. No point using it until I found an incorrect paper bag that just about fitted. Young staff cycling around don't carry these items also we had three tea spoons and not four in the cutlery drawer so please don't charge us for a missing one. Come Friday we started the lovely great queue to get out and stayed just about static for a good hour and then I smelt exhaust fumes coming in and the engine started to shake badly so we had to pull into a small lay-by near a lodge and put the bonnet up. Another forty minutes went by while the other cars tried to turn left onto the main road from Pine Lodge. Nobody there to act as a road marshal. Tried to get the attention of a member of staff who told me that this was standard practice at Elveden? We managed to phone up the nearest dealer in Norwich and crawl down the A11 and of course by then it was too late to go to the Aqua Sana for my wife's extra visit that morning plus a bill for ¬£665.00 from the garage. Perhaps if you happen to live at the end of Heathrow Airport and enjoy nail guns going off most of the day and new tarmac being laid down on the so called cycle routes then it might not worry you but it was not my idea of a quite relaxing holiday with disgusting over pricing since the big boys have taken over CenterParcs.

I appreciate some things break but a notice advising people the changing room are would and the reason why would be nice. Sat in le Jardin at this moment and haven't seen 1 member of staff cleaning tables. I have just had to clean my own table. There is food all over the floor. It's disgusting. I will be pleased to get back to my own CLEAN house. For the price you charge Center Parcs I now think you are greedy money grabbing gits.

groupe_11,"Finally bowed to peer-pressure so off for a short 1/2 term break. We opted for a (pot luck)woodland lodge which turned out rather well. Although part of a block of four we couldn't see any other lodges from the big patio windows and looked out right into the forest.Inside the lodge was big enough and plenty comfortable enough (good beds) and in pretty good nick. Plenty of facilities on-site and a short walk/bike ride away and lots to do.OK everyone knows the big attraction at Center Parcs is that it is fairly weather resilient. The big pool complex is good with enough slides, flumes etc to keep two boys very happy. There is a big range of indoor and outdoor activities; what you do depends on two things - booking in advance and the size of your wallet.And I do stress the latter. Apart from free access to the pool complex, pretty much any activity be it high ropes, climbing, quad bikes etc will set a family of four back ¬£100 a time. And it would be easy to do two or three such activities a day. Bikes are a near must to get around. To hire for 3 days? ¬£100 for 2 adults; two children. And it doesn''t stop there. The onsite supermarket has a very hefty mark-up of a good 50% on Tesco's. Bear all this in mind when you consider the 3 day w/e cost us ¬£800.We enjoyed the stay but I would suggest going outside school holidays if at all possible. Take as much food/drink with you as you can as this will save you loads. (Although the same mark-up didn't seem to apply to the one restaurant we went to - Caf√© Rouge - which pretty much cost the same as the one in town.) Take your own bikes/scooters/rollerblades with locks and lights.Some non cost tips. We got there in the dark - and it was very dark. Signage isn't as good as it might be so make sure you take torches and have them to hand on arrival (and not buried in luggage). Look out of the window - we saw several deer and a stoat right outside the lodge (plus more squirrels than you can shake a stick at). If intending to eat out, book in advance as all the restaurants got very busy.And I was very pleased to see that stoat...",0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0

This has multiple slides and rapid outside. It's such good fun and younger children especially will enjoy it. Our entertainment includes mini golf, bowling, going out on the lake, the pancake house, archery, the spa etc etc. Food and drinks - obviously the lodges are self catering, but there re a number of restaurants you can go to. Hucks is nice. The spa - I obviously love the spa - it's the best one in Nottingham in my opinion.

Sweetie shop was a daily after swim treat. Staff go out of their way to help and entertain. Play areas indoors and outdoors. The restaurants Bella Italia and cafe rouge are both good with children nice food and have a small soft play area each. Pancake house does not work for my little one as she does not like pancakes or omelettes and pasta dishes are too spicy for little ones. Hucks has the biggest play area and is the best equipped for children. However eating out, take away and supermarket are all a bit pricey for us and we choose to save money some days by eating own food at the lodge. Our lodge sauna had a fault and the emergency stop button melted onto the floor of the sauna overnight. We hadn't even had chance to use it yet. However as soon we realised a member of staff had a technician there within 20mins to investigate and attempt to fix the problem. The staff worked hard to make up for the issue and made sure we still had a good time. They were very good and although it initially worried us we were assured any fault found would be sorted/parts replaced in all the saunas if they could find the cause. Housekeeping were friendly and made some cracking towel animals. Arrival cleanliness of the lodge wasn't great but I can rinse a bath out etc. Walks were beautiful and wildlife to see both out and about and at the lodge patio doors.

I've also been to Sherwood, Longleat and Woburn (not a fan of Woburn - please see below). However, some things are starting to go amiss. The bathroom wasn't as clean as I would like it. Someone else's hair in the bath... not good. Plus the bathroom sink was slightly blocked. How did no-one notice? The beds used 'down' rather than synthetic fibre, which is harder to clean, and it felt that way. They covers were way too insulating (during a heatwave), and no obvious option to get something more appropriate.Also, pretty much everything else is at an extra cost, and it's not cheap. Most things are about an extra ¬£10 per person. Lots of activities can end up costing a fortune!Still, the pool is free, which includes a nice variety of entertainment. Definitely a great way to put a smile on your face. The walks around the grounds are also a great way to enjoy nature and relax. The animals even come to the table outside your chalet. It's a great place for a getaway.Additional: Personally, I wouldn't recommend Woburn though. It's like a normal Centre Parcs, but a lot smaller and less fun.

groupe_12,"We went to Elveden for a long weekend break with family and had a mixed bunch of reviews to give. After visiting Longleat, Woburn and Sherwood Forest we decided to give this one a go for a change. Firstly, a evening spent at Aqua Sana, the spa was  lovely but needs to have the water Beds and cosy corners focused on more frequently. Blankets were often screwed up and wet - not inviting at all. The spa itself was lovely, very spacious and clean with a lovely pool area on a sunny day.   I went for a freestyle deep tissue massage which was lovely. However, when I was sat waiting for my treatment a lady with short blonde hair, and a grey suit dress (potentially a manager?) was stood at the tester stand dousing her face in products and then moving onto using a oil all over her arms and legs. I didn't feel like this was very professional to be doing in guest facing areas. Friday night we ate at Hucks, the food was lovely but the service was very slow. We waiting 20 minutes between saying no to desserts and  for our bill to arrive. Saturday we had a amazing field archery session with Chris G, he was so knowledgeable, passionate and very sociable within our team. None of us had ever done it before and I was terrible to start with but he was patient and guided me into the correct stances and by the end of the session I was happily shooting every animal on the range.  Thank you for making this such a memorable experience for us. We also went and did the tree trekking experience which was good fun, Jasmine was very friendly when doing our safety briefing and was good at yelling words of encouragement to our team throughout our climb. Saturday night a meal at cafe rouge, unfortunately again not very good service received during this meal. Drinks not bought our untill after our dinner has arrived on the table, no steak knives given to those of us eating steak.. I asked for some extra garlic butter for my steak which took 10 minutes to arrive so by the time it came out my steak was already long gone. Cheeky to still charge me for it. The gentleman singing in the meal area was absolutely incredible, he has such a beautiful voice and I was definitely concentrating more on his songs and performance than my meal. Sunday we did lots of fun activities such as tennis, paddle boarding, swimming etc which was all good fun. Sunday night we went to Bella italia for dinner and had a amazing meal for a change. The menu had lots of really good options on it and Jess our waitress was spot on. I'd strongly recommend their strawberry and prosecco cocktail it was fab!   Jess was so helpful and nothing was too much trouble for her - exactly how it should be when paying CP prices for these restaurants.  Had a amazing chocolate and cherry pudding here (being gluten free I was massively chuffed with this dessert) Al in all a fun weekend away with family, activity staff were all lovely and what would be expected at centerparcs but unfortunately hucks and cafe rouge staff did let us down on this visit.

Later we went for a walk and we were surprised how close to the village centre we were considering the carpark was at the end of our road. I went for a run later that evening and struggled to do a decent 5k, Woburn is quite small in comparison.We used the pool every day after 5 for an hour as it was quieter, with fewer young families so we could get a changing room and the toddler friendly areas were less crowded. It was smaller than expected and there water toys that were available in Whinfell Forest were not in Woburn. The positive for the pool is that for a toddler it was ideal as he could move between all the different areas on his own steam and I was happy to follow him! They also had little water slides which he had a great time sliding down!We didn't eat out as we didn't get round to it In all we enjoyed our stay but this site feels like it is geared towards the young family with size an amenities. It's also quite hilly so not sure how those with mobility concerns would find it. I would say the disappointment was that some of the restaurants weren't open, we would've had breakfast if they were and there seemed to be a lot of traffic constantly on the move.

Very expensive holidays here but we suck it up because we enjoy it so much. We only do it once a year.  Check in for us was Friday after school at around 5pm and it was about a 1/2 hr wait in the queue and my nerves were in tatters because i had stupidly booked bowling for that evening at 7.30.  I under estimated how long it would take to get there, with delays on the M11 and then how long to check in and unload, get bikes off and return car.  It spoilt the 1st evening as i had to rush our evening meal.  I tried to cancel to book later but would have lost over ¬£20 due to cancellation fee, so we just made it in time by rushing- shame (not CP's fault).  Lodge was spotless but again only literally having 1 set of thin towels and 1 set of cutlery means it is a pain as you have to wash them after every use. At over ¬£500 for accommodation for 3 nights this is pretty poor.  ! small frying pan and a couple of pans was about it, but a lot of plates and cups.  Lots of birds and foul but no deer, so next time we will go back to being away from a lake.  Comfy beds and replacement sheets following an accident (no questions asked!).  We loved the flat bike rides around the complex, the kayaking, climbing (excellent value), table tennis, pool and badminton.  They should have had someone on the 'beach' to help with getting the boats into the water rather than leaving to staff.  Upset that i did not factor in having to have my pottery fired over night, so factor that in if you want to collect fired item after noon the next day.  book early for spa and treatments but other activities can be booked at the time.  Disappointed that the new wrist tag pool lockers were faulty several people spend a lot of time finding lockers that actually worked and we almost got all our towels/clothes locked in the locker when the wrist tag failed.  Pool changing room crowded and a bit dirty (tampon on floor- unused thank god) and dirty wipe/hanky in a changing room.  They should employ people to walk around and clean up.  Pool was fine but gets cold in the wave section and very very crowded.  We ate out once to save cost as we had a voucher but were very impressed with mussels, french onion soup and seafood stew in Cafe Rouge. Kids cocktails lovely and adult cocktails fine at ¬£7 and my long island ice tea had tons of alcohol in it.  We got cold at night and would have enjoyed a snugly blanket but we lite the fire which was lovely.  Some of the best outdoor activities are ridiculously expensive and would be circa ¬£100 for 2 kids and 2 adults.  Most people seem to come with large family groups and this can be a bit noisy for those of us in a small party for example, they may well hire several lodges next to each other and constantly walk about between them, which i dislike.

We were so pleased with our accommodation which was very convenient for both main area and country club . The games room was invaluable and all bedrooms had an ensuite . A lovely large kitchen with 2 fridges and a wine cooler was very useful as we had taken our own food but  ate out one evening in Foresters .  The food here was very average , although the staff were wonderful with our little granddaughter.  In summary,  center parcs  have a fantastic formula for ensuring families can enjoy every type of activity you can imagine . High chairs and food warming facilities are everywhere along with soft play areas in all restaurants .  However it is far too costly in the restaurants , bars and supermarket and some of the activities should be free for young children . Some of the outer zones seemed a little run down and I would recommend Hiring cycles if you book these areas in order to get to the main centre.

groupe_12,"I recently stayed at centre parcs in Elveden having stayed there before all be it some time ago. As on my previous visits, there was as always plenty of things to do, and the swimming facilities are exceptional. The lodge was clean and warm, with all mod cons.However in regards to the local shop for everyday items and eating out, different story altogether. In short in regards to the  the local shop, centre parcs knows it has a captive audience, and therefore the costs are astronomical even for the most basic of provisions.As for the eating out dining: We had a meal out at a so called Italian chain restaurant, and I can honestly say it was the worst pizza I have ever had in a restaurant, Not only that, the cost was over inflated to say the least, which for all intents and purposes was a frozen pizza placed under a grill. I spoke to other customers on the following day, and they had similar experiences in other eating establishments on the site. Staying at centre parcs is not the cheapest holiday/ break you could find, which is fine, as it is not marketed that way. It is marketed as a relaxing quality break, and this quality is reflected in the amenities, but certainly not in the restaurants, no one likes to be taken for a fool for very poor fayre. It maybe be that because these are chain restaurants, centre parcs can only  exert limited influence on the cost of the dining experience. Well that is between centre parcs and the restaurants. However I feel that in the long term more and more people will be put off by the dining experience, if one can call it that.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0

We adore the place!During this stay, as we always do, we used the Parc Market's shopping delivery service. We have never had an issue. We did our shopping at lunch time and left it, along with our  villa number in the usually capable hands of the staff. We spent the afternoon enjoying the amazing facilities around the site and headed home to have a BBQ for our dinner. Shopping is supposedly delivered to the villa by 4pm and upon arriving back just after 6pm, we discovered that our dinner had not been delivered. I rang guest services straight away to report the issue. What followed was very strange! The Parc Market staff were absolutely adamant that the shopping had been delivered very shortly after it was purchased and even asked us to double check!? It took over an hour for this issue to be sorted. In the end, as they clearly could not locate the items, they simply took our receipt and re did our shop. When it was delivered at the villa, the manager came along. He suggested that his staff member was 100% certain he had delivered the shopping in the early afternoon and he asked us if there were any signs that someone had been in the villa. I suppose he was suggesting that someone may have stolen our shopping! The whole situation was absolutely absurd and while the manager was not rude he certainly implied that he didn't believe us! I was so offended I told him to check the cupboards and fridge! What I found the most annoying was that we didn't really get any kind of apology or offer of some kind of compensation. I felt a little uneasy at the suggestion that someone might have been in the villa without our knowledge. The manager was not directly rude and we did eventually get some shopping delivered but I felt really put out as a loyal customer who always spends quite a lot with the company, they could have been more apologetic about the situation and certainly not suggested that we had stolen from them!Not good enough this time.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,

With hindsight had I known that the non-renovated lodges were that tired, I would have saved a bit longer. Its very disappointing that you have to pay more to stay in the same style lodge that has been given a new lick of paint. The bathroom was grotty, mold in all the grouting, paint peeling off the roof, a tap that felt like it was about to break every time you used it, the plug for the bath packed up on the last day, and there were thick cobwebs above the bed in the main bedroom - definitely not been dusted in a while.

The staff in every department are incredibly helpful and friendly. But.. what we are noticing more and more is the volume of guests now and the new lodges that are being built every year. The Swimming pool was unbelievably busy, the outdoor area and rapids were heaving, you couldn't move without touching someone.

It would be great if there was a larger venue with perhaps live music and a disco in the evenings for entertainment.We stayed in one of the brand new exclusive lodges.

As we have two young children we liked the fact the Parc was flat, as it meant we were able to get around easily. But because of this we felt the landscaping was better/more interesting at Longleat. There were also a number of cars around during our weeks stay, which really irritated me as I had to constantly watch my older son and one of the benefits of a holiday here is that you shouldn't need to look out for cars. The staff at the restaurants and pool were friendly, and the food was ok. The baby/toddlers area of the pool was always very busy. The changing rooms were full constantly. I'm not sure how this is handled in peak season but I did wonder how the use of the pool is monitored especially with locals possibly popping in for a swim. Plenty of choice of activities and the parks were great for the kids.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Think my mum had some issues with her villa which customer services rectified and gave us a ¬£45 voucher as a good will gesture so all was well. Just want to say a special thanks to the first aid staff in the pool! My daughter somehow cut her eye open down the blue flume slide... no idea how it was caused but just an accident. One of the lifeguards noticed I was panicking with the amount of blood so ran over and called for a firstaider. A guy came to check her out think his name was ash but had a mark name badge on, he managed to calm my daughter down and gave first aid. Please pass on my thanks for the help and organising a driver to rush us back to the villa so we could go to hospital. We then got a call off the medic on site today to check how she was. She's doing fine :-) Also the new tree adventure course is amazing!!! Zip wire across the lake and the instructors were great!

Now while the Friday to Monday break was very reasonable at around ¬£90 per person, the costs of things while there were really expensive, so we didn't do hardly any of the activities due to this.We ate in 4 of the restaurants for dinner which were the Sports Plaza, Hucks, Cafe Rouge.  Out of all 4, I would say that Hucks offered not only the best value for money but also the staff were extremely helpful compared to the others.  However I will say that the staff in the pancake house were always smiling.  If you do eat out at any of the restaurants please do be prepared to pay between ¬£13 &amp; ¬£18 for a burger with fries.If you decide on eating in, then I do strongly recommend the on site supermarket as it isn't that much more expensive than your average supermarket, for instance milk was 59p a pint, they had deals on most items and it really is worth while spending the extra few pence if you have a lot of luggage.We found the park staff to be extremely helpful with general enquiries and were never in a rush to get rid of you.  Now other than the brilliant swimming pool on site, my favourite part of the break was the nature aspect, with Deer's, Squirrels, Ducks amongst other animals, coming up to your lodge for food, while the Deer's are extremely timid, the Squirrels &amp; Ducks would happily eat directly from the palm of your hand.  If you love nature and have never experienced this kind of thing, then it really is a heart warming thing to see.The lodge that we stayed in was stunning &amp; the beds were really comfortable, with close walking distance to Village Square.

The activities were brilliant, we booked badminton courts, roller skating, indoor climbing wall and Pilates.Please prebook any activities prior to arrival as everything is always fully booked! All activities are over priced &amp; for a much shorter than you would usually expect.  Despite this we all enjoyed the activities &amp; the climbing wall is excellent.Like one of the other reviews has mentioned, the volume of lodges have increased drastically but not increased any of the facilities. The swimming is the only free activity, and the volume of people going in and out is completely unsafe. It isn't monitored in any way. There are not enough changing rooms, showers or facilities to cope with the volume of people going. The rapids are very unsafe with the amount of people going down. There isn't enough seatings in any of the venues.Food in the new sports is extortionate. ¬£7.95 for beans on toast!!! The chalets have been refurbished but the bedrooms still feel damp &amp; still have very thin curtains and being woken up at 745am by a garden strimmer is not what you want to hear when you are on holiday relaxing. The heating goes up and down constantly. You turn the heating up and within a matter of no time the thermostat goes down again. This was not a fault on the thermostat in my chalet as it was the same int he other two family chalets.When we have been previously, no cars have been allowed in the forest, however there seemed to be a constant stream of cars through the forest all weekend and not only the staff of centerparcs.

groupe_12,"After hearing so many great things about Center Parcs we decided to try it. We were really disappointed - upon arrival it was dark and both lights leading up to the lodge were not working - having to unload the car and walk up steps etc with only the light from our phones was a nightmare. Then having to find a parking space in the car park was a hassle too - they need more parking to accommodate growing numbers of guests and day visitors. Plus I can't see the point of having no cars on site and strict 10mph rules if their own staff and contractors are going to be speeding around the site constantly - they need to stick to the 10mph too. The lodge wasn't clean - the floors were black if you wiped them with a baby wipe - they had obviously been swept but not cleaned and by swept I define that as the cleaner had simply swept all the crap under the beds and sofas! It was disgusting. The plug in the bath had months worth of hair in it - curtains and cushions had stains on them - the only clean thing was the bedding which was spotless - thank goodnesss! The heating was a nightmare - set onto an eco setting - which is ridiculous at this time of year. Had to constantly keep switching back on - and went off from 11pm until 6am so the lodge was ice cold.  The walk to facilities was really long and not ideal - but that was an oversight on my part. I'd def recommed ensuring that you are close to the facilities. Swimming is the only real activity included  free of charge but it was chaos - way too many people using the pool and not enough changing facilities to meet demand - had to queue to get a changing room - not ideal with a toddler when you are dripping wet after your swim. Everything is overpriced - drinks , food and activities and most things booked up if you haven't booked before your trip.   I wouldn't return - I was totally unimpressed by the whole experience.

groupe_12,"I will be completely honest when I say if you are a family with young children then Center Parcs is probably the best sort of holiday you will get in England. However as a couple in their early 20's, this is probably (definitely) not for you. Everything is expensive. From the food to the events and things to do. You need to have a lot of money to afford to have a break. Even a long weekend will set you back ¬£1000+. And that's without hiring the bikes! Here are my top tips: Avoid the Cafe Rouge Roast Dinner on Sunday's - it's dry as anything. Avoid buying a cocktail pitcher, it's mostly ice and you'll be lucky to get 2 drinks out of it. The SPA is a complete rip off and you're best to find a spa elsewhere where you will actually get your money's worth. The plus points: we stayed in the Breckland Apartments, perfect for a couple however be prepared to walk everywhere! It's the other side of the park to everything. We had a lovely lady clean our room daily, and her name was Tracey. We didn't need our room cleaning at all over the weekend but she did show us how to work the coffee machine and provide us with toilet roll and tea bags when needed! She also received our recommendation of STAR EMPLOYEE over the weekend as she was the only one who interacted with us and wasn't rude. The rest of the employees will ignore you if you're not a family. Which brings me into the negatives: Vinny and Pablo behind the bar in the Leisure Bowl are RUDE individuals and should be avoided. Not only do they skimp on the drinks, they whisper amongst each other about the public and we actually overhead Vinny say u201cI can't be bothered to deal with thisu201d and walk away from a customer. The water park is dirty and doesn't look as though it's had a clean in a long time. No wonder the stench of chlorine is so strong! My partner came out in a rash every time he went into the pools.

groupe_12,"Just returned from a very enjoyable midweek break at Center Parcs Sherwood.  The weather was not particularly kind u2013 to be expected in mid-January u2013 but it did not stop us doing what we wanted to, even if it was very cold in the wind at times.  As previous guests of Center Parcs, we knew what the prices would be like in the ParcMarket &amp; restaurants (expensive).  We did some careful planning and took all our food and drink with us, even doing a top-up shop at Tescos in Ollerton before arrival at the park u2013 the saving was considerable.  Given the cold weather quite a bit of time was spent indoors, but we did do the new Aerial Adventure &amp; really enjoyed it.  Yes, we could have done GoApe at Sherwood Pines for less money &amp; a longer course, but it was good to be able to get back in the warm soon afterwards.  One place Center Parcs seem to be missing a trick at Sherwood is the lack of indoor seating in bars / coffee establishments.  When walking around the village on a couple of occasions we thought we'd drop into the Country Club for a coffee / drink u2013 not a chance.  The relatively few tables in the bar section were always taken &amp; the staff would not let you have drinks only in the dining section.  Loads of outdoor seating which may be nice in the warmer months, but this is the UK / Nottinghamshire!  The above was repeated to a lesser extent in the Leisure Bowl u2013 we did always manage to find a table in the Sports Caf√©, but this is hardly the same environment as the Country Club.  It is clear that over the 30 years that Sherwood Forest has been open, Center Parcs have milked the site more and more for as much money as they can take.  What were once open spaces now have more lodges crammed into them (doesn't the Center Parcs TV ad that is running now give an impression of open space in the forest in touch with nature?  Not much of it at Sherwood Forest!)  We did some further diggingu2026 when Sherwood Forest opened in 1987 there were about 650 villas/lodges.  There are now about 980.  The USP (unique selling point) of Center Parcs, i.e. the Subtropical Swimming Paradise, has remained all but the same size in these 30 years.  Yes, there was a small extension a few years after opening &amp; a new Grand Cascade slide 7 or 8 years ago.  The basic infrastructure of the Swimming Paradise, i.e. the wavepool, outdoor pool &amp; rapids have not increased in size in any way, despite the accommodation on-site being increased by around 50%.  Many of the new lodges are big executive lodges all with 3 or 4 bedrooms too.  Development work is taking place to extend the Swimming Paradise by mid-2019, but from the plans I could find online the basic infrastructure will not increase in size.  We have all agreed that we would not return to Sherwood Forest Center Parcs until serious work is done to address the capacity issues.  (Bare in mind the 3rd week of January is hardly high-season either u2013 dread to think what it is like in the school holidays).  We will, however, happily return to Longleat Forest which we fell is a much nicer setting than Sherwood.  Yes, Longleat is very hilly by comparison (which makes for good exercise on the bikes!) but the setting amongst giant redwoods is stunning.  One final comment u2013 Center Parcs are giving out incorrect information in every Lodge at Sherwood and on the TV when you turn it on.  There is a card in each lodge &amp; a page on the TV about keeping the village car-free.  It clearly states u201cIf you choose to leave early, you can bring your vehicle on to the Village on a Thursday or Sunday from 4pm.  Simply collect a pass from the Arrivals Lodge or Guest Services; from this time you'll have one hour to pack your vehicle and start your journey home.u201d  We went to Guest Services at 4pm on the Thursday to ask for a pass to be told u201cthe information in your lodge is incorrect, only the Arrivals Lodge can issue you a passu201d.  Come on Center Parcs, get 980 new cards printed for the lodges at Sherwood with correct information on u2013 and change the digital page on the TV!  Finally u2013 I am sure Sharon Press u201cGuest Services Executiveu201d will fail to respond to this review as it's all things that Center Parcs know need fixing u2013 but know that can be fixed easily &amp; cheaply.",1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,-1.0
groupe_12,"I've been to centre parcs many a time and always go to Elevenden Forest. I feel now that it's becoming to much much of a money grabbing holiday. 3 nights will cost you at least ¬£400 for 4 of you. I check for next year and it's ¬£480 in October. The amenities there are very good and the pool especially is brilliant. The biggest problem I have is everything is getting so expensive. The shops are all designer, the supermarket although not ridiculously expensive is still pretty steep. The restaurants are more expensive than similar ones in the normal towns. This in itself is kinda to be expected on a holiday but my BIGGEST complaint is now two years running the villa boiler hasn't worked so no heating and no hot water, you call and they do come out and fix it but still wastes a couple of hours for something that shouldn't be broke. The villa wasn't particularly clean so we did that ourselves which was the same the year before. The worst thing though was the decor. The walls had plasterboard nails showing through and all the plaster falling off which for this sort of money is not acceptable. They seem to be so intent on building more and more villas/apartments so they can just syphon in more money that they seem to have forgotten to look after the older ones. It's a shame as with nearly a 1000 villas they must be turning over at least ¬£300,000+ for the 3 night break I was there. Surely they can pump some of this back into keeping the older villas up!

groupe_12,"Had an amazing weekend as usual at centerparcs, we love coming here every year.We stayed in an executive lodge which was worth the extra money as the kids (teenage) have their own on suite bathroom as do we! The lodge was clean and well equipped and the room service this time was excellent ! It was very poor in Woburn previously, this time the lodge was cleaned well and extra tea towel/ toilet roll etc supplied. I just wish they would change the towels at least once as they do get used a lot over the 4 days. We ate out at Bella Italia and the sports bar both of which were surprisingly good and not too overpriced. The drinks in the sports bar are very steep though ¬£5.60 a pint ?! The swimming pool area is good fun for the kids to be entertained for hours. I hate the system of the changing rooms as it's always chaotic and cold. It's impossible to find free changing rooms and you have to walk up and down pushing every door apologising to those you open the door on by accident along the way.  The changing rooms need desperately updating. The swimming area itself also needs an update. We went in to the adult hot tubs which were surrounded by dried up chewing gum that people had clearly stuck on the surroundings a long time previously. It's grubby everywhere, stained and broken bits here and there. However all said it's good fun. It's just a bit grotty for the expensive prices. Will be back next year of course.

groupe_12,Center Parcs offers an ideal option for young families wanting to spend some quality time together is a nice woodland setting.  This is a great choice for you if you like spending time together in a family fun pool and perhaps trying some new activities from the many to choose from.  Be aware though that it's not cheap and the prices of activities are generally fairly expensive and geared for the captive market on the site.  There is no charge for the pool but pretty much everything else is extra unlike holiday centres of yesteryear.  Pre-booking is also recommended if you are there over school holidays as restaurants and activities do tend to book up quickly.,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0
groupe_12,"As I've only given 1 star I feel I must start by justifying the reasons, Center Parcs it's self is really really nice and the most organised place I've ever visited. From the moment you drive in there is someone on hand to answer any questions you have and give concise directions to your lodge, we drove to our lodge unloaded and then returned the car to the car park which was very busy and I was surprised by the amount of visitors to the park, until I found out you can check out and then use the facilities until midnight on your departure day. We hired or 13  year old daughter a bike which at ¬£30 for 3 days I found reasonable as it was well maintained and good quality equipment and complete with dynamo type lights. The tropical water park is great if a little overcrowded at times. During our stay we ate at the sports bar which I must say was slightly above the expectations we had for burger and chips type meals, the food and drinks aren't cheap but not overly pricey. On the Saturday night we had a table booked at Hucks the on-site American diner style restaurant. This is where it went downhill there were 12 of us in total with an advance booking and the restaurant wasn't especially busy. Our waitress dropped of menus and said u201cI'll be back to take drinks ordersu201d after 20 minutes we had to ask if she was on her way back. On her return they had run out of Chardonnay (7:30pm?) the drinks took so long to arrive she had taken our food orders and gone away again! We had 3 children who opted for the buffet to which she left 3 plates on the table without comment on how or where they could feed themselves, fortunately kids will always find chicken nuggets and hotdogs. Our food finally arrived and the quality was a real let down, when our waitress asked if everything was ok the food was still arriving and she left before any answer were given or in some cases the food even being tried. When we did complain we were given a 20% reduction to our bill which while welcome we would all rather pay for fully but enjoy a meal out. Some guests didn't eat 30% of their meals. That unfortunately put a damper on the whole night which was 13th birthday treat Center Parcs definitely a big YESHucks definitely a very big NO NOT EVER AGAIN",1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0
groupe_12,"We absolutely love this place and come once or twice a year. Noticed a lot of change over the year.. my main issue is the cost of food and especially drinks. I think this has got to be capped at some point? The beer in the swimming pool bar has gone up by 50p a pint in the last year, and about 35p in the sports bar. For this reason alone we will be looking for an alternative for our 2nd break this year and our 1st break next year. The staff we're all fantastic throughout the Parc.Not taking bookings at the pancake house is pretty terrible tho.

Sat on the floor blocking the entrance/exit.Disappointed the driving range has gone but the family putting looked fun.

Tony (manager) is brilliant, what a lovely bloke! And our waitress (Danielle) was fantastic, chatty and smiley! Big plus for us.The swimming was good as always however, heating needed turning up! The kids have never got out of the water complaining about the temperature before! They did this time and it was cold poolside too!

I stayed with my husband and 5 year old twins.we didn't eat out this time as we prefered to eathe in and keep to routine. The villa we stayed in was very well equipped and clean.  We stayed in 276 Cedar and it was 5 minute walk to the activityellow centre. We accessed it through the footpath and car park.  The villa has a small lake at the back so we got lots of ducks &amp; other wildlife at our patio every morning. The duckstaff tap the window with their beaks for food and when you open the door the squirrels run in and take food from your hands. My little ones loved it and couldn't wait to feed them every day. We lit the fire a few nights and toasted marshmallows which was fantastic. We swam late afternoon around 5/6 o'clock which suited us. The pool area is fantastic and lifegaurds very helpful and friendly. The chsng8bg area can be a bit hectic when busy and not the cleanest but this is due to the amounts of people wearing outside shoes.Our most enjoyable activity was crazy science. We enjoyed doing it together as a family. The staff member running it was brilliant.  We drank in Starbucks in the square which was nice. Didn't get to sit by the fire as the seats were always taken.the toy and sweet shop was great and lovely staff.The only moan I'd have is at the forresters arms. Ripped sofas and  ¬£5.00 for a hot chocolate that wasn't filled even half way and was cold. Great way to spend quality time as a family.

groupe_12,"To be honest, I found Sherwood to pale in comparison to Whinfell in regards to pretty much everything. The staff weren't as friendly/helpful. The layout of the centre wasn't as inviting. The main swimming pool was cold and the rest seemed to be not well-managed (for example two or more people going down the rapids at the same time as you resulting in me getting kicked several times, in the head on one occasion as well. Our lane at the bowling was faulty, the pins wouldn't reset properly and when we approached a member of staff for help, she cheekily commented that our lane is fine, as if implying our request for help was a burden to her.We also had a rather large cobweb in plain sight in one of our bedrooms at our villa. They came out and cleaned it when we asked, but it came as quite a shock to us to arrive to that. It clearly wasn't freshly spun.I realise most of what I'm saying is negative. The holiday was okay overall, putting these things aside. Our hired bikes were great, the meals were great albeit ridiculously expensive, and we did get a couple of staff members in places like The Pancake House and Rajinda Pradesh, who were particularly nice. But that should be expected in all of the places.I love Center Parcs, but I do have to say that Sherwood is quite a big disappointment in comparison to Whinfell.

groupe_12,"I think this is our 15th time over the last 17 years that we have been to Center Parcs (most of them to Sherwood Forest).  This time we stayed in a New Executive Lodge 3 bed with a Sauna (No.323 Cedar Area).  Plus points first:(1)Lovely relaxing environment in which to spend a midweek (with caveats-see below)(2)Great time having a Mud Serial Treatment (would recommend)(3)My daughter and her friend loved the Quad Biking(4)Restaurant food quality and service always good(5)The parking areas around the parc to drop off your cases etc have been improved.  No more muddy patches to step into in the area we were in(5)Aqua Sana continues to be invested in (also a downside-see below)(6)Service in the Parc Market was great (as always)(7)Location of villa was greatNegatives :(1)Too many cars are being left around the parc during the week which spoils the relaxing environment somewhat.  Center Parcs make a big emphasis on being in the forest in their adverts.  I think they now need to have cars dotted around the forest in their adverts next time to reflect how it actually looks!  I wish they would take a stronger stance with people who flaunt the rules.  Maybe they could make people leave a ¬£200 refundable deposit when they book and not refund it if visitors refuse to move their cars?(2)Center Parcs continue to increase the number of villas within the parc.  Some of these look out of place due to the fact they've been built on open land and then had lots of sapling tress planted.  These should look good in 10 years or so but till then, they don't seem to be in keeping with the rest of the place.  This leads to the next problem.(3)The growth in the number of villas means that there is much more footfall around the Village Square, Sports Centre and Aqua Sana.  While we were there, they were doing some work around the Village Square and I believe that will be expanding the Sub-Tropical paradise in the future.  The Aqua Sana has been completed and whilst it has grown to accommodate the increased usage, sadly the intimacy of the place has gone.  Now instead of going into a sauna which was enclosed on all four sides and catered for say, 10-15 people, now it's a glass fronted affair that looks like it could take 30-40 at a time.  This leads to much more noise when you are in there and a less relaxing and intimate experience.  I suppose that's the cost of progress?  Still u2013 at least we had a sauna at the villau2026u2026(4)Sauna in villa wasn't working!  When we came to use the sauna the day after arriving, it didn't switch on.  We rang Customer Services and the team arrived promptly to tell me that the emergency button had been pressed and that it needed to be reset.  They said I could have done this myself and told me what to do, however the sign above the button says contact customer services and doesn't tell you what to do.  When I asked if this was something housekeeping should check when preparing the villa for new visitors, they said no.  Why not build this check into future villa preparations?  The staff also implied that we had pressed the button which was frustrating.  We explained we hadn't touched it, but they kept referring to us having done it!!!!(5)No menu/magazine in the villa.  When my wife checked the welcome pack for opening times of the restaurants it referred us to the magazine in the villa.  Again, another call to customer services who sent someone (promptly again).  When they arrived they asked if we had checked everywhere, which we had.  They then said it was supposed to be next to the vase in the lounge/dining area u2013 to which my wife said that was missing too u2013 awkward! u2013 we also asked for a menu as there wasn't one on those too!!! (6)The gas hob controls were loose so made using them difficult u2013 again u2013 why isn't this checked on handover?(7) The cost of the restaurants is bloody expensive! If you're planning to eat out, take a big fat wallet or purse u2013 you'll need it!Overall, some of the negatives are not big things (the first three listed are to us though), but in previous visits they didn't happen so it's become noticeable to us.  Also, the prices go up, not down, so you expect the consistency of good service to be maintained, which on this occasion it hasn't.I'd still say Center Parcs is a lovely place to go, just not as lovely as it used to be.  We will give it a miss for a few years now and I'm sure we'll miss it enough to want to return and if we do, they may have upped their game.

I believe our booking record highlights that we are good customers. Center Parcs is ideal for my baby daughter who was born with very complex needs as she loves swimming in warm water. Our recent experience however was tainted directly by the staff marshalling traffic during check in. Our party was in two large vehicles. The lead vehicle was checking everybody in. My father parked behind us as he intended to follow us and park next to us in the main car park so that my mother and he could help with the two babies. For some reason unknown to me my father was told to overtake and park up by a lady in a high visibility jacket who was marshalling the traffic. He explained that he was with the vehicle in front however the lady in the high vis jacket insisted he drive on as he was blocking the traffic. On this occasion we barely had to queue but she was very insistent.I was sitting in the parked lead vehicle with the window open so could hear everything. My wife who was the driver of our vehicle was on the left of our vehicle checking in at window 4.Reluctantly my father moved slowly forward being continually motioned forward by the traffic marshall. His vehicle was dead centre to the available gap he was being motioned through yet made contact with both our vehicle and a log on the other side which damaged his front bumper.My fathers vehicle was now trapped alongside us and could not move until we were able to move our (lead vehicle) forward. My wife had to get in the passenger door. He should of argued with the marshall to stay put but instead he put his trust in her and obeyed her persistent instruction to his and my cost and upset.  I feel strongly that responsibility needs to be taken for the actions of the traffic marshall on this occasion whose intentions of keeping traffic flowing lead to this unnecessary collision.My father was both flustered and harassed.What is most infuriating is that over a week later we have yet to hear back from Center Parcs.

Our accommodation was an apartment across the far side of the car park. The view from the patio was a high panel fence beyond which was the car park. The accommodation was a good size but that is about all I can say that is positive. It was not particularly clean and it certainly did not feel like an idyllic forest escape, given the poor location and the hideous number of cars we had to walk past every time we wanted to go anywhere. The sub-tropical swimming pool was cold and so crowded that I considered it dangerous. We stood shivering to queue for changing rooms and showers. But largely because of the excessive number of people trying to use the facility we only went in it once during our stay, it was an unpleasant experience and I was constantly worried that my daughter was going to be hurt due to the shear number of people trying to use the slides, which seemed totally unregulated. Also nowhere to sit outside of the pool. Sports facilities similarly overcrowded. I also felt for the money more should have been provided. I was not aware we had to take our own towels for the pool and there were very limited provisions in the accommodation, towels, soaps etc totally inadequate. I consider far too many people were admitted to the site which totally ruined it for me. The reality was much removed from the impression given by the television adverts.

The prices increase for all things but more so here it seems. We enjoyed a few booked activities and would return if price allows. ",0.0,,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,-1.0

groupe_12,I have just returned from my annual trip to Center Parcs Elveden Forest and had the best time as I always do. I went with 8 members of my family and we have all been going in one way or another since I was 18 months old and I am now 32 so it has a real special place in my heart.When you are there you really can do as much or as little as you want to. We played badminton a couple of times which was easy to book and get a court. One session we booked in advance of arriving and one we booked when we were there and looking for something to fill some spare time we had. We also played Ten Pin Bowling. There was a slight issue with our lane and the bumpers wouldn't go up so the manager very kindly issued us a refund for the trouble. We went on a Kata Kanoe on the lake which was good fun as well.I went to the Aqua Sana to have a treatment and as always the staff are so friendly and nothing is too much trouble. It's a real treat to go there and you always leave feeling relaxed and refreshed. I also had a shellac pedicure whilst I was there by a lovely young lady called Sophie who did a wonderful job and i love the end results.I didn't use the swimming facilites this time but other family members did and they had a brilliant time.The villa we stayed in was really nice and just perfect for what we needed it for and in an excellent location that we were near the Aqua Sana and Country Club and only a 10 minute walk from the parc market and the the village square.The only bad thing about the holiday was that it had to come to an end but my family and I are already in discussion about returning next September.,0.0,,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,-1.0
groupe_12,"I've stayed at Center Parcs all over the UK for years and always raved about it. Our most recent stay at the end of Sept was our first family holiday with our 5 month old.We paid extra to book a specific lodge, 376, as the master bedroom was detached from the neighbouring property (on a previous stay I was woken up every day by the neighbour's children).  I was disappointed by the condition, especially considering it was supposed to be a refurbished woodland lodge. Not sure what exactly was refurbished about it. Other than being generally run down and worn, the bedrooms were a bit grotty and full of flies. The kitchen was ok, but the bathroom stank of urine (one look at the dark yellow stains on the toilet seat explained why), the grout of the shower was dirty, the bath full of dirty marks and the bath handles were loose and caked in thick black mould.  I was particularly disappointed when I looked at the patio, I lost count after 20+ of how many cigarette butts all over the patio. The village is getting seriously over populated. They keep just building more and more accommodation but without expanding the facilities. Everywhere i looked there were people smoking, even with prams and babies around.We ate at Hucks one night which was excellent and lovely service. We also had afternoon tea at the lodge which was nice, you don't get a lot for your money but it was enjoyable.We went swimming and hired a Cabana. Wasn't really worth the money. it was too noisy to enjoy the space, it was just handy having somewhere private to sit.

The car free environment meant our 4 year old could learn to ride his bike over the weekend without us being worried about him getting squashed. We also went to the pool everyday - kids really liked the &quot;lazy river&quot; and the waves. The toddler pool was a bit too busy and loud for them and some of the rides were closed. They also really liked the playgrounds and the soft play which was in the sports bar so we could enjoy a drink while they played. We found that the kids had enough to do at their ages without any paid activities.

groupe_12,"I gave two stars from our recent visit to Centre Parcs because it seems to be the only way of catching the eye of its management.  I noted with interest that some previous reviews charged Centre Parcs with complacency and greed, from which I have to agree.  Of far greater concern, is the recent expansion of the 'Pine Area' where Centre Parcs is also in danger of threatening its own Unique Selling Proposition.  For me, Centre Parcs is about family connections within the forest environment (at least that's the message from the TV adverts) yet over at the western end they're built 4 bedroom detached houses outside the forest belt in the hope that they can grow the forest environment around them.  Look at the attached photo and see for yourself - its like a new suburban Barrett housing development. I just don't get it, why would anyone want to leave their suburban home to holiday in another?  This new expansion compliments the total of 1000 lodges in the entire Sherwood Campus which explains why the changing rooms in the swimming pool couldn't cope and backed up with queues to the entrance of the Aqua Centre and queues for the water slides reached over 30 mins, and I also discovered that many using the pool were u201cday visitorsu201d.  The bar in the Jardins de Sport was a scrummage 5 deep with thirsty customers, and cars were climbing up the trees in order to park in the car parks.  The golden rule here is 'infrastructure first, before developing any expansion'.Another problem is that the cleaning staff are not being supervised - I watched many of them and never saw their work followed up management or any team leader.  In our case, after checking-in, our dish washer was covered in algae and the filter was full of broken glass - it was so bad the entire unit had to be cleaned twice by the emergency housekeeping staff who finally capitulated and called in for a brand new replacement.  The wood burning stove wasn't emptied of ash and the stove glass was opaque with tar.  It appears that the standards of housekeeping is measured by complaint - a rather upside down approach of reactive management rather than a proactive management, and I refer to where I started with the issue complacency.  The trouble with complacency is that those who are guilty of it, can't see it themselves and they're often the first to be in self denial.  Basically this is simple Hotel management and leadership failing.Whoever was responsible for auditioning the entertainment troupe for Pantomime either didn't read the brief or deliberately sexed up the marketing for it.  The Panto was billed and therefore sold to us a 'bonanza of family entertainment' and we bought 6 tickets at ¬£15 each.  Note u201cfamily' implying both children and adults.  However within minutes of taking our seats it was obvious this was a kids Panto tailored towards under 5s, and Centre Parcs failed to make that clear.  We gave it a chance after 30mins after which we eventually voted with our feet and walked out, and drowned our sorrows at the Jardins de Sports with a few games of pool and rejoined the 5 deep scrummage at the bar.The other thing that's fairly recent and new, is this 'Executive' status.  HATE IT and there's no need for it at Centre Parcs!  The Nation is socially divided enough without you further subdividing the status of your guests.  Even the old bungalow cabins have executive status now with dedicated executive parking spaces. Having said all this, one can't deny the impeccable standards of Centre Parcs.  The Gala Dinner and the Fireworks was fantastic, the Christmas decorations and lighting was spectacular, and the activities were superb. However at what price to sustain such high standards?  For Centre Parcs they compensated us with a brand new ¬£400 dishwasher plus ¬£100 meal vouchers for the inconvenience, 2 Botts of champaign, and two free deserts for messing up orders during the Gala dinner.  BTW for all those reading this, we didn't demand or ask for any of this compensation -  Great news for us, but not for everyone else since I should imagine correcting all these faults probably explains why Centre Parcs is criticised for being so expensive.

My biggest gripe was when we went to discuss a complaint regarding the fact our Villa heating didn't work from day one and after nearly 4 hours and 3 different work men it finally got sorted, we spoke with &quot;Gerry&quot; who didn't give us eye contact or even say the word Sorry, she left us at the desk to speak with her manager and came back offering us some meal vouchers? All we wanted was an apology and when we told Gerry this her response was &quot;oh I do normally say sorry?&quot; Again another example of bad attitude from team. We had to get housekeeping out as the Villa was not clean and not acceptable for the amount of money we paid to stay.

The staircase creaked so badly that if anyone got up during the night for a drink etc. Everyone else was woken with the noise. Very poor accommodation in general. Lodge 869. We have stayed in some beautiful places much better maintained and updated that cost a lot less than the ¬£5200 we were charged.During our stay we had resteraunts booked. Hucks was our 1st and although we didn't pay for one of the meals because it was inedible the other 7 all enjoyed theirs.Cafe Rouge was the 2nd and the service, food and whole experience was so poor that we were offered a 40% discount on the bill by the manager which is fine but I would rather have paid full price and enjoyed the experience.Bella Italian was the 3rd and everyone enjoyed this restaurant. By far the best.We ordered take away twice and tried different things each time but all was as expected...poor.On New Year's Day we went to Forresters Inn and this was the worst of all. The slow service(20 min for drinks to arrive after ordering) and over an hour for food to arrive. Had to ask more than once where both were.

Sadly I was told help would be some time. I tried to park my car, sadly Centre Parcs staff allow many many persons to park their car over two spaces therefore reducing parking spaces by many. I made my way to the Help visitor centre where no assistance was offered, Sadly the only reply received was &quot;yea, parking is a problem&quot; not very helpful, I parked at the side of the road in which was the safest available... Upon walking to the lodge, a centre parcs bus, which only had a driver in, drove around me whilst walking, saw me struggling with my walking and luggage, but did not stop or offer assistance... I finally found my tiny lodge and tried to settle in. That afternoon we went to the swimming area which I must say was so disgusting and dirty, it made me feel sick... how on earth you can allow the pool, spa's and hot tubs to have so much brown rusty coloured staining is very very disturbing, I have a pool at my own home and never would it be allowed to get in such a state, you should be disgusted with your customer service and hygiene levels....",1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,-1.0

Had also opted for early check in from 2pm, normal is 3pm so not sure I would do again but might be better for others.  Wow what a lodge! Villa was huge with four bedrooms each with ensuring. Games room was fab addition and the hot tub/sauna/steam room a really treat. Was clean and in good shape, could do with a lick of paint here and fix up there bearing in kind cost. Fully equipment with everything you would need. We were lucky to have deer, squirrels, stoat and more appear for food and to say hello! We had pre-booked activities six months ahead which is best way to do it and did bowling, laser combat, raft building, segway and line dancing. All were brilliant but favourites were raft raft building Segway. Sian who did the Segway activity was fantastic, knowledgable and so passionate about her job! Thank you for looking after us and note we completed a recognition card with your details. Rowena who managed the raft building was also excellent and we didn't stop laughing and having fun for the whole time. Did book badminton session day before and there was space so all good. Onsite restaurants were lovely - sports bar and pancake house. Supermarket has everything you need but we brought loads with us which is the best thing to do. Gift shops had lots of choice and we all picked something up! Swimming pool is big and we loved the rapids (lost count in how many times we went on)Didn't use spa as had our own hot tub but looked pricey!

groupe_12,This is a very beautiful park and has some really lovely wildlife. We booked a short break (mon-fri) in one of the executive lodges. The lodge itself is quite nice but it wasn't very thoroughly cleaned before we arrive. There were some stains on one of the loos and the carpets looked like they were just spot cleaned. There also were some massive cobwebs hanging off the door frames. They were not cleaned during our stay so assuming they're probably still there ud83eudd23. We precooked the breakfast vouchers that can be used in three of the restaurants and although we only tried two of them (not tried the sports cafe) I have to say they are fantastic value for money and would definitely buy them again. Breakfast is served until 11.30 which gave us plenty of time to get up and get ourselves and our little 5 month old baby boy ready in the morning. Unfortunately though when we arrived no one told us where we get them from and on the second day we were send round the houses (40min if walking around!!!) by various members of staff looking for the right place to collect them. Eventually we found the 'Guest services' which is totally unmarked and located inside the sports centre... because that makes sense...not! The breakfasts were all really tasty and all the restaurant staff were very nice so would definitely recommend getting the breakfast deal. It's a shame the restaurants are so overpriced though. We had a meal out one night and have to say totally not worth the money. If we were a little more prepared I would have gotten some food and cooked myself. On the other hand the take away service they offer although again grossly overpriced the quality was superb. We had some of the Asian dishes and they were generous portions and very tasty. The little parc market is very steep on some things but quite reasonable on others. You can pick up some lovely ready made buagettes and little hot meals like goujons  and chips that are really nice and not too expensive. There are also lots of supermarkets just minutes drive from the parc so actually very easy to stock up on food and snacks. If you would like to feed the ducks and other wild birds pick up some feed in advance or from one of he supermarkets as the little parc shop sells them at ¬£5 where you can get a massive bag from Tesco for ¬£1! This may sound like quite a bit of moaning but we did have a really lovely time. The parc is beautiful and it's lively to be able to go for nice walks. Unfortunately as our little one came down with a cold the day before our stay we didn't get to go to the pool but even without it there is plenty to do for everyone. And as the WiFi is fantastically fast in the lodges my partner and I spend the colder evening in the sofa watching movies on Netflix after our baby went to sleep. Would definitely recommend this parc to all families and adults as there is something there for everyone.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,0.0,,0.0,

We filled in our check in information on-line which saved some time.  We were given wrist bands which acted as keys for the lodge and also locked the lockers in the swimming pool.  A brilliant idea. We had a four bedroom woodland lodge.  It was spotlessly clean and we all had crisp white bed linen and white bath towels.  There isn't an en-suite bathroom but there was a bathroom, separate shower room and another separate toilet.  Our lodge backed onto a little lake which was lovely as there was plenty of wildlife to see from our patio doors.  Dog exercise areas are quite small but there are acres of woodland to take the dog for a walk in.  Swimming pool was fantastic and you could easily spend half a day in there.  My husband and I braved the Cyclone ride.  It was well worth the wait.  The rapids were great fun too.  There were lots of little pools and activities for smaller kids. It was lovely to be able to bring our dog on holiday with us and we all had a great time.  I would highly recommend this place for families of all ages.  Two of the kids hired bikes and the other 2 brought their own.  Lots of tracks and off-road trails for cycling.  I would definitely recommend hiring a bike.

I just hope more smaller chutes are added not just big rides which have no disability access. The disabled changing rooms were always used by families maybe a special locker band system could help so only disabled can use them. We were disappointed that the xmas displays were turned off on the friday 29th. Everything is geared up for families with little ones but nothing for teenagers has been added in a long time.

The venues are good what centre parcs need is a loyalty discount card system or to reduce prices to match the quality. Everything's a couple of pound overpriced but without the service to match.

groupe_12,"This is my first review I've done for Tripadvisor but I deemed it necessary. Just got back from 1 fantastic week at Centre Parcs - mid September, Friday to Friday. I did not pay for our lodge so I'm unsure on price but it was an Executive No. 68 for 7 of us (3 females, 23-27, 3 males 27-32 and dad (age unknown)). 4 rooms, huge living, dining, kitchen area and games room complete with pool table, XBox One and big TV.I'll list my personal pros and cons at the end, but I was very impressed. This is my second time visiting Elveden and it was easily the best (and not just because I celebrated my birthday here that week). The lodge was perfectly tidy and clean with everything you could want for your week (minus food - but thats up to you). A message was even left on our own personal blackboard from the cleaner wishing us a happy stay.We pre-checked in online before arriving which I highly recommend (so much quicker). We also pre-booked the following activities:Spa (Monday evening) for 5 of usBack massage (for me)Ariel Adventure for 3Archery for 7Birthday meal at Huck's for 7.We took with us all our rackets (badminton and squash and racketball), disposable bbqs, golf clubs and alcohol, plus some chilled food like bacon, sausage and then bread.You can honestly spend what you want to spend at Centre Parcs, either on a budget or full exclusive. We went fairly exclusive as it was our first holiday in a while. Weather was a right mix of heavy rain, clouds and sunshine but we just went with the flow and it didn't effect us at all. Two of our pack caught colds but the Parc Market is more than stocked with enough different medication to keep you on your feet.Pros:- (again, I'm being fair and honest)1. Lodge was fantastic, perfectly set up for our week, fresh beds, wine chiller ready to go and all the information you could shake a squirrel at.2. Bike hire was quick, efficient and we were ready to go in no time. One bike was stolen on the evening but it was replaced with no hassell the next morning. All bikes were perfect and worked.3. Having the pool table in the lodge was just brilliant for passing away the rainy evenings.4. Birthday meal at Hucks - spot on. Great staff, great decor, great coctails and great food (shout out to those Franks Hot Wings - perfect!)5. All staff at the activities were brilliant. Archery was led by a girl very similar to Arya Stark from Game Of Thrones and she was very informative and helpful. Really made the most of it.6. Adventure golf is a laugh, just try and not get stuck behind people playing with kids.7. Sports Bar provided great sit down food, TV coverage of football, cricket and the Formula One race (yay!). And also had a great arcade.8. Bowling alley was great.9. The golf course was great if you like to whack your balls. Visited 3 times and got better each time. (Dad dropped my handicapp from 4 to 2 and the last game was tense as we were neck and neck by hole 9)10. Really nice bike rides to be had around the forest with some steep drops to ride down should you feel the rush.11. The pool! Wow! They Cyclone was amazing and such a rush, as was the rapids. We visited 3 times and the busiest was the Monday. Tuesday and Thursday it was pretty empty so we had no big queues for anything. Highly recommended and great locker system with wrist bands (they control everything).12. The shops around the village are great for everything you could need. And for gifts, sweets, coffee etc.13. DVD hire we used twice, just because it was raining. I recommend taking some films with you (bluray player provided in the Executive), but they were still nicely priced at ¬£3.95 for a evening.14. Bathrooms in the lodge were spotless, fresh towels and some pampering provided. 15. Treat yourself to the Spa. I had a back massage (first one ever) and it was amazing. Very relaxing, got rid of those &quot;desk twinges&quot; and then to move into the 12 different relaxing rooms was great. Plus the pool in the middle - jets of water, bubbles etc. bliss.I could go on and on, I think. I wouldn't hesitate to spend a great week here. Here are my genuine cons about our trip (but they did in no way spoil the fantastic week).Cons:-1. The lodge did have a few flies buzzing around, but this could have been down to having the doors open a few times. They sit on the ceiling but fly down (obviously) onto your legs at times.2. The rooms in the lodge at night got very hot. Especially with the duvets provided. You could just open a window, I suppose, but me being morbidly afraid of spiders, didn't want to do this. But then again, open a window and see if any come in! Didn't see a single spider in our lodge at any point.3. The price? Just expect high prices everywhere. Hucks is worth what you pay but I don't think the meals in the Sports Bar were worth what you pay. Parc Market has slightly higher prices than a supermarket but not so much. Red Bull cost a lot and only one size available (unless buying a four pack)4. Babies and pushchairs everywhere. Can be like a maze at times. But it's a family place, so... Just makes me think &quot;kids... meh.&quot; (sorry girlfriend)5. Getting to and from the lodge with your stuff on arrival can be stressful. Cars all over the place, most parked in front of your lodge, so just be quick and expect to lug a lot of stuff from car to lodge.6. Squirrels everywhere. Even cheeky ones that come in your lodge, looking for food. Lack of bunnies this time. Saw a stout, though. That was fun.7. The Pancake House was a bit of a let down for me. But then I didn't eat anything. They looked amazing, don't get me wrong, but our drinks were left on the side for ages before we were served (I was gagging for my orange juice).8. Hmmmm... This is a bit controversial. The Country Club. Absolutely brilliant for a drink after a round of golf but the food quality seems to have diminished. Last time there was camembere and whitebait on offer but now its just regular sports bar food like burgers and fish and chips. The girls got all all dressed up for this evening and we ended up with &quot;no pies available&quot; only burgers and fish. A more posh variety would have been nice. Bring back the camabere and waitbait! We didn't try the Sunday dinner, but its available.  I couldn't rate higher enough the services provided enough for our trip. Everyday we were offered housekeeping (only accepted once and they did a great job). Don't let my cons put you off, only providing my niggles. Such a good week so thank you very much.

The cabin we stayed in was perfect for our family of 4. The two bedrooms were a good size and the two toilets were a bonus, the bathroom, kitchen and lounge area's were great and well equipped. We participated in a number of activities including Quad biking and den building, the staff were great with the kids and made their day. The pool was amazing fun we couldn't get the kids out of them. The changing area was crowded but once through there the pools were not that busy. We had our Christmas lunch at Hucks and had a lovely day. We are at the Italian and had a takeaway in our cabin both of which were fine for the money. The whole experience was great and we will return one day.

We ate at Bella Italia which was very nice, l do think the restaurants miss a trick by not allowing vouchers to be redeemed, also one of the restaurants used to do 2 for 1 on the fish and chip dinner on Friday which was excellent, this should be done again. We played badminton, tried Pilates and had a great relaxing time.

I believe you can get there for anytime Friday and leave at any point Monday but you are unable to get into your lodge/ leave by 3pm. (I could be wrong - double check!) We stayed in the Executive Lodge with a kitchen, lounge, dining area, 2 double bedrooms, 1 single bedroom (all with en-suites) and a sauna. I'd never stayed in a lodge myself and I really wasn't expecting anything luxurious! I thought it was lovely and very modern. The rooms were spacious and included a small dressing table, wardrobe and shelves, TV and bedside tables. The en-suites had showers. When we arrived Friday evening we went to the pool for the last hour before it closed. The pool has a wave machine which runs every so often. Around the pool there are water slides. We went on the Tropical Cyclone which was thrilling! I wasn't expecting anything like that but it was certainly fun. With that they capture a picture of you at the end which you can get printed inside the Sports Plaza. There was also a lazy river and rapids. The rapids had us all laughing. I thoroughly recommend a trip to the pool. You could easily spend a good half day in the pool as there is plenty to do! - especially for kids. Saturday we went for a bike ride in the morning around the park. I love how cars were to be left in the car park at the entrance for you to bike around everywhere. In the afternoon we had the spa booked 2-5pm. We were hoping to book some treatments but when we went to book they had only 1 appointment left which was no good for 5 of us! I will say that if you're looking to book a treatment do so as early as you can because the appointments soon go. However with just the spa booked it was a lovely, relaxing few hours and plenty to do. In the evening we ate at Rajinda Pradesh. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal! After, we looked for somewhere to carry the night on with drinks but most places didn't seem lively enough for us. Sunday we visited the pool again in the morning and had Segways booked for the afternoon. I'd never used a Segway before and was dreading it. Don't be fooled though as it was a great experience! We then ate at The Pancake House. There was plenty to choose from for both sweet and savoury. Again throughly enjoyed my meal!Overall a lovely weekend away! I was exhausted come Monday but it was well worth it. Everything on site was fairly pricey so I'd advise planning what you want to do beforehand.

We are a family of four but having older teens we went for the basic lodge but 3-bedrooms.

Our sweet course was lovely but we ordered it as soon as the main course arrived so that we weren't waiting all afternoon. No one asked us if our meal was ok and no one seemed particularly interested so we didnt get the opportunity to mention it. We were probably more disappointed than usual because it is so expensive.

Around 50 ducks and geese at our window each day!We liked the swimming area, although it was very crowded with it being Xmas break and we did struggle to get a changing room on occasions.
