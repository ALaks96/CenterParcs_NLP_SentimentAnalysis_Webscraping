We were in a 2 bed VIP cottage which I chose close to the high ropes course and the archery. I do like that you can pick your specific cottage when you book and don\\u2019t just get something assigned to you.The accommodation was lovely, clean and spacious with lovely design details. Really excellent, couldn\\u2019t fault it. We really enjoyed all the park facilities as well. Over the weekend we had two visits to the aqua mundo swimming pool, and the kids did high ropes, archery and horse riding. My younger daughter also loved visiting the farm which you are free to just wander around. Lots of goats, cows, sheep, chickens, peacocks roaming free. We spent about an hour feeding hay to a goat (which the goat could access perfectly well without our help, but try explaining that to my 5 year old).My only complaints are that for some reason the app Planet Centerparcs, which you can use to book activities, isn\\u2019t available in UK App Store. I never got a straight answer on why this is, it is available to literally every other nationality. This meant we had to queue at reception to book activities, which was annoying.Also, when we took then kids pony riding we had to lead the ponies ourselves. All the ponies wanted to do was eat grass, and we had to yank hard on their reins to get them to move, or we got yelled at by the one employee leading the entire pony ride. Not being horsey people ourselves we felt entirely out of our depth and didn\\u2019t enjoy this. Similar activities at UK Center Parcs provide one staff member to lead each pony, which was what we were expecting!

Unlike a lot of the UK Centre Parcs that in the main need a good overhaul and refirb to keep up with their European equivalents. Note though as a family we have travelled to three French CP\\'s now and of course the main language is French a lot of the activities for children are also in French so if you have little ones that do not understand the language it can be a tad challenging but it has not put out two off. Both aged 6 &amp;8 Yrs. The staff do make an effort, and they are helpful. The activities are in line with most other parks but check out the age and height restrictions in advance of booking if you can. We have had to book separate activities for both children on numerous occasions which can be daunting for a little one especially if they do not quite understand the language. All the pool areas are clean and slides are great in line with what we expect. We have noticed over our past few visits that the use of vehicle buggies has increased. It can be unhelpful if you have two children that have just learned to ride their bikes and they are trying to build their confidence -buggies whizzing past is not helpful. The hiring of a vehicle to get around if you are infirm, have very small children that genuinely cannot walk or ride long distances makes sense. However, we have noticed the huge increase in what looks like quite able-bodied people, teenagers etc running around in them. I appreciate that not all disabilities are physical so we do try and bear that in mind. We have been to this park twice now and enjoyed both holidays very much. We have had all manner of animals at our villa, deer, rabbits, frogs, the kids have loved it. I would recommend not relying on the restaurants for food, it can be expensive eating out all the time. There is a small grocery store and deli with fresh bread and croissants etc, a gift shop with a varied range of the usual bits. NOTE to UK travellers, do not expect the same branded restaurants and retail that you see within the UK CP\\'s - the European sites just do not do this. No Starbucks/Costs/Cafe Rouge ert. Stock up at a local supermarket in advance. Note though if you buy frozen food, you cannot get into your villa until after 3 pm so again try not to shop too early. There are some impressively built tree houses you can rent here although we have not managed to get one yet as they book up quickly. I cannot recommend the EU versions of CP;s enough, its half the price of the UK sites and you get the warm weather.

It should be great but an accumulation of small failings let it down.The Good:- Paris aside, this appears to be the newest of the Centre Parcs and that is evident throughout the site.- Unlike other complaints on this site, our house was clean on arrival with the beds made. - The onsite Carrefour is small but has what you need.  Prices appear to be 20-30% higher than a large supermarket.  The fresh bread is great.- Aqua Mundo pool is great and has many different areas for all ages.  (It was getting very busy towards the end of our break though).- Hiring a bike (c. \\u20ac50 per week) or an electric golf cart (c. \\u20ac240 per week) is a must to get around.  This is a big park and thankfully reasonably level for the cyclist.- The deer - you get pretty used to seeing deer outside your window!- Outside the park you have the beautiful Loire Valley with many good attractions within a 30-90 minute drive.The Bad:- Service, service, service!   Few staff have any English.  With a few exceptions, most seem uninterested in serving the customer.  Reception is particularly unfriendly.   - No air conditioning turns the houses into an oven each night.  No amount of fans could counteract it.  It was 36 C at peak during our visit but about 46 C indoors!- The gardening!  We understand you have to cut the grass, but there was a major operation on every day for a week whilst we were there.  Very noisy and lots of pollen for those who suffer with hay fever.- The park location is about 30/40 minutes drive from any other reasonably sized town - i.e. any large supermarket, any restaurant etc. - The restaurants are average at best.  Considering the premium prices charged they could do a lot better.  Frozen pizza for \\u20ac14!- There is no oven in the houses.  You have a crisping microwave which is less than ideal.  A tiny electric barbeque is \\u20ac10 per day.- Prices for every activity are at the upper end.   Other than the pool, expect to pay through the nose for bike hire, outdoor activities etc. I imagine they have \\'revenue per guest\\' targets!- There is really no sign of any management - aside from a large photo of them in reception.  The whole park seems to be missing that \\'hands-on management by walking about\\' skill.- We were there at the end of June and it was already getting very busy.  By the first week of July the pool was pretty full.

We are near the end of our stay so here are my observations of this CenterParcs.1. There are no mosquito nets fitted to the windows and patio doors which is mind-boggling given the very hot weather and the bugs were everywhere.2. There is no washing machine in the cottage or on site!! Two weeks with three children and three adults, we really needed to be able to wash clothes. I called reception and they sounded actually amazed that we would want to wash our clothes and said that there are no washing facilities on site. Even the most basic campsites in France have washing machines!!3. I advise calling reception on the phone in the cottage if you need something, you are more likely to get someone that can speak even a little English. Unless you have very good French the staff throughout this CenterParcs do not speak English. We met a few who could help in English, my French is poor, my husband is very good so if I was on my own with the children it was very difficult. We were not the only Irish family (or English speaking family) in the facility so having staff that can converse in more than one language should have been a given.4. Be prepared to spend a bit on activities, only a few of the activities are included in the high cost of the cottages.5. Half Board - If you are planning to eat each morning and evening in the park then go half board as the cost of the food on site is much higher than local restaurants. It is a very restricted half-board menu mind but it is a cheaper option than paying per meal. the breakfasts on site are better if you get it delivered to the cottage, there is a limited selection of food for breakfast in the center.6. Local Area - take the time to visit the local villages and towns, we found some lovely places for lunch/dinner and the cost is very low. Two-course lunch for three adults and three children for less than \\u20ac50 in Saumur, fantastic.7. Wildlife - the nature aspect of CenterParcs will blow your mind, we had deer roaming freely through the back garden, it was wonderful to see and the children loved it.Overall the model CenterParcs use is great, you have your own space to enjoy the facilities provided at your own pace. Will we go back to CenterParcs again, probably but will we go back to this one, probably not.

(Very expensive!) If this was my Centre, and given the amount being spent, I would assign a rep to welcome families especially to VIP lodges and be that family\\u2019s go to person for any query or issue.In fact we felt management was virtually invisible except for their notice board and photos; we never saw a manager.That said, a real treat came from the way the deer freely roam past your back or front door.The Aquamondo is also very good. The one slide that was well supervised was the Crazy River (sauvage). On our 1st morning we went into Cocoon restaurant and I speak a little French but was met with an ignorant waitress who mocked my attempts to speak to her in French. There were flies everywhere, and no blue lights to deal with insects and apart from the fabulous freshly squeezed orange juice it was a very disappointing experience. We gave it one more chance for a family dinner but that was also a disaster. 1 waiter was very helpful and his English was very good. Food was not up to scratch.Whilst the lodges are spacious, with excellent open plan quarters for all the family, without air conditioning in 31c heat, or nets on the windows, it was very uncomfortable. Had to buy a fan. Also the restaurants on site were very disappointing. The best of them was the Italian. Staff in there were very pleasant and helpful. But the food was ok for a night or 2 but not for 2 weeks. Pizza not the best.Advice: Go out of Center Parcs to nearby towns like Saumur and get a smashing meal for a fraction of the price on site. Or self cater. The delivered breakfasts are also largely good.Bikes should be free of charge, or included in the cost of the lodge as you need them to move around. We phoned asking for additional towels in our second week, to be told they would cost \\u20ac7 extra each to rent. We went to the Supermarket and bought some for the less than that and brought them home with us. We did the archery, which was fun, and the paint balling. Also fun. Both attendants were helpful and fun. Bottom line - was very disappointed given how much we spent with Center Parcs. We love France, love the language, and the fabulous culture but this place is getting it wrong because of all the added expensive extras with a captive audience and the poor quality food.Also as a suggestion there was no traditional authentic French caf\\u00e9 to take a break in. Nor was there a bar worth visiting after dinner. When you go VIP, it should mean VIP. Perhaps complimentary tickets to go bowling and free bikes for the family should be standard plus a rep or host / hostess to meet and greet you.Other issue was impossible to sit out on the smashing deck at night for fear of being bitten by mosquitoes.

The cabin was spacious and well equipped, it appeared to be clean and in good order. So far so good.The grass surrounding the cabins was really long and untidy, not sure if it was to make the site look rural, or because they couldn\\'t be bothered to cut it (I suspect the latter as the fenced off dog toilets were also knee high). One effect of this was that there was an amazingly high level of grass pollen in the air, which had my wife\\'s eyes swollen and sore throughout the week. We were unable to book activities on line and although the staff we dealt with they did make mistakes. The worst leaving my ten year old daughter to cope with the disappointment of being turned away from the pony ride she\\'d been looking forward too all week, because she was too tall, something the woman at the stables told us they had informed the information desk of several times.However, the greatest disappointment of the whole holiday was the evening experience; on the second evening we went down to the Dome at about 9.30, where a quiz was taking place, which we joined in. We tried to attract the waitress in order to buy a drink, she studiously ignored us for over 20minutes until the people on the table behind us pointed us out to her. She came over and announced that the bar was closed, I was understandably annoyed at this, particularly as she had been serving other tables during the time in which she was ignoring us. The quiz was still going on, a rather strange business model as I thought that the idea was for people to have an enjoyable time. On our last evening we booked a bowling alley with a 9.00pm start, the bar was lively, with karaoke, until 10.00 when the bar closed and everything stopped dead; whilst we were finishing our drinks, my wife took my daughter to the loo and then had a heated argument with a female security operative when they tried to re enter the bar. Five minutes later everyone still in the bar were hustled out by a large number of security guards. Absolutely appalling! I find it totally unacceptable that the evening &quot;entertainment&quot; finished so early, we were on holiday and had paid good money to have a good time, not be treated like a group of hooligans. All the other Center Parcs that we have been to stayed open to a reasonable time. If there isn\\'t going to be evening entertainment, perhaps there should be a warning on the website, we certainly wouldn\\'t have gone to this site had we known that we were to be treated so shabbily and sent home to our cabin earlier than in a working week.It appears that the camp site is happy to take people\\'s money and run things in a manner that is convenient to themselves and not their customers.With consideration an better customer care it could be a first class destination. I\\'m pleased to say that despite the camp site\\'s short comings we had an enjoyable holiday.", "title": "Early to bed....", "rating": "3", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/a8/31/8b/center-parcs-domaine.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Bois aux Daims", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Route des Trois Moutiers", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Nouvelle-Aquitaine", "postalCode": "86120", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "June 7, 2018", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " May 2018"},

Check in was easy - arrived just after midday and drove straight to the gate, received our welcome packs and wristbands and then directed to the day parking. Very quickly decided we would need to hire bikes so that we could enjoy the vast area which the Parc covers - too much walking for our 4 year old son! One thing to note if you get free activity vouchers as part of your package you need to go to the info desk to get these loaded to your wristband. Our premium VIP cottage was spacious, clean and well maintained with a nice decked terrace and outdoor sofa, table/chairs and lounger. We backed onto a wood so saw plenty of deer in our garden area during our stay - only downside was that our garden was next to one of the main paths leading to the Dome with a makeshift fence and so not very private for sunbathing on our terraceFound the whole Parc to be very quiet most of the week -  Saturday and Sunday were very busy and the Aqua Mundo was packed to bursting - but took the opportunity to spend time away from the Parc to visit the beach at Candes Saint Martin which was nice. Our son loved the soft play area and the numerous play areas dotted around the Park. My only criticisms of the parc would be:1. the lack of open areas to play ball or lay out a picnic blanket and also the lack of picnic tables (probably 5 in total throughout the park). I understand why this is the case in terms of ensuring people pay for the activities and buy food at the restaurants or onsite supermarket. But all the same disappointing. 2. The showers at Aqua Mudo - only a small number actually work. 3. Lack of milk - little one loves his cereal and there was no milk in stock during the whole of our stay and had to go to supermarket in Loudun.Would visit again and recommended the place to numerous friends who love Center Parcs in the UK.", "title": "First time at Center Parcs and pleasantly surprised.", "rating": "4", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/a8/31/8b/center-parcs-domaine.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Bois aux Daims", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Route des Trois Moutiers", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Nouvelle-Aquitaine", "postalCode": "86120", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "June 29, 2018", "trip_type": "Traveled with family", "trip_date": " June 2018"},

The first thing was that we had to queue for 45 minutes to even get into the park.  The chalet was a good size and was well equipped.  It was fairly clean though there was dirt under the sofas and the shower doors needed a good clean.  The park itself is well laid out and we really enjoyed cycling and walking around.  The pool complex is good though very noisy and it\\'s very easy to get lost from your party - make a rendez-vous!  The changing rooms however are not adequate and we had to queue to get changed - no fun hanging around in wet costumes especially with children.  Showers were cold too.  The spa was OK but access was through the pool complex which took some of the &quot;spa&quot; feel off the experience.What really drove us mad was the difficulty to book any of the activities.  The app and the website are not easy to navigate and don\\'t have much detail on about times etc until just before the holiday, and even then it is limited and difficult to access.  The option is to go and queue up to book (only 2 places to do this and never enough staff on), which is not what you want to spend your holiday doing.  It all felt like quite a fight to get our week organised and booked.  We couldn\\'t understand why they couldn\\'t have issued a programme of times of events and/or have had bornes to make bookings situated around the site.Plus the activities are rather overpriced.  We didn\\'t eat in the restaurants as, having read some previous comments on prices we decided to cook our own.  However we did have some drinks and found them to be expensive.The shop is expensive too - 2 euros for a bottle of milk is unjustifiable.  My advice - take as much of your own stuff as you can.Finally, take some good bite relief cream as we have all been bitten by something though not evident what.  This seems to be a comment others have made too.So overall, it\\'s a good place to go but do your homework and plan ahead - as far as you can!We were left with the feeling that Centreparcs want your money more than they want you to have a good time, which is not how you really want to feel when you\\'re away.  Of course it\\'s a business but it\\'s certainly not got the feeling that the customer is at it\\'s heart.  Shame as the concept is a good one and there are, as I say, many positives.My message to Centreparcs is to get better organised and think of the convenience of your visitors - we are your bread and butter and if you don\\'t do this you will end up with dwindling numbers.

Beautiful surroundings- we chose a VIP chalet for 8 close to the Dome. Spacious, comfy and well equipped with a huge private terrace and garden that was very safe for small kids play. There was plenty to do between the Aqua dome (loved the crazy river and toboggan slide \\ud83d\\ude06), huge soft play area, mini farm, animal trail etc. Carrefour was well stocked if a little expensive. Did one trip to E leclerc in Tours for a big shop. On-site restaurants were good. Food was generally nice and service friendly enough. We found the circus buffet with soft play area handy with the smallies: great desserts but you\\'d get bored of the selection of mains after a day or two. The Italian was also nice. The fact that kids under 4 eat for free was a good incentive for us not to bother with cooking in the chalet. We hired bikes which is probably only necessary if you\\'re a good distance from the dome or going off site; we\\'d finished exploring the park on them in about 40 mins but enjoyed it and found them handy for nipping to the shop, car etc. And enjoyed a moonlit cycle by the river looking at the treehouses.Great selection of playgrounds and overall fantastic facilities for kids and families.

The Action Factory was disappointing, as although it was summer season, by 8pm, they were switching everything off and closing before it was 8:15pm, when they were supposed to be open until 9pm.

The villa itself was fine and was all we needed for 7 days. The park is large but we brought bikes and used them to get around to everything including the Aqua Mundo, kids play area, shops and restaurants etc. My family and I loved almost everything about our stay with some minor issues that unfortunately prevented us from awarding 5 stars.- We checked into the villa at 3pm, it hadn\\'t yet been cleaned which was disappointing. The toilet seat was broken and we were promised this would be reported and fixed asap. This never happened for our entire stay and remained broken rather disappointingly.- We ate at the Italian restaurant once and the food was excellent. The service was poor however, the waiter kept us waiting for everything we needed and clearly ignored us when we tried to get his attention. When you have young children hungry and tired as parents you hope that staff in a family resort would be used to dealing with this.- The swimming pool was excellent, we visited everyday and used everything and enjoyed each visit. However, at the end of the week I grew a little suspicious of the cleanliness of the pool. Seven days of seeing the same bandaids/plasters on the stairs to the outside slide made me query if any form of cleaning takes place (or at least how often).- Constant queues to book activities. This was always a significant wait and was extra frustrating as UK visitors cannot currently access the Planet Center Parcs mobile app through the UK AppStore.- Lastly, as mentioned we used bikes for all our getting around, it was great for our children (4 yr old twins) as they are just off stabilisers to learn/practice. I grew very frustrated with the number of golf buggies, the speed of them and that they can also use the narrow pedestrian/cycle paths. Given the family friendly nature of the resort and the number of children riding bikes (or walking) we grew very frustrated constantly having to stop our children riding to move over to allow golf buggies past. Some of these came though very quickly (both visitors and those similar vehicles used by Center Parcs staff).The end of August saw some very hot days and we would have really benefited from the villa and the indoor soft play centre having AC. It was so warm at times, the only real options to cool down were the swimming pool or the bar with the indoor bowling (this was air conditioned).With some simple fixes this resort really can be a 5 star review:- Up the cleaning standards within the pool- Restrict the golf buggies to the larger road areas only- A kids toy corner in restaurants would really help for times when waiting staff are busy- Allow U.K. guest access to the mobile app- Ensure when faults are reported they get fixedAs a said we loved our stay, it was just frustrating that simple things stopped it being great.

A huge variety of quality, exciting, fun and well presented activities and experiences with an emphasis on adventure and outdoors.  Clean, private and spacious accommodation.  Great for bike riding (roads inside the parc are car free) and also nature trails. Here\\'s the cons.  Its impossible to plan anything in advance. Central reservations can\\'t take activity reservations (so very stressful if you have a large family, limited time and have pre-paid for a lot of activities).  Emails go unanswered and phone unanswered. Even central reservations told me it\\'s a problem and they can\\'t get hold of anyone here.  The activities are really well done; but, and this may sound obvious, very few staff speak any English.  It\\'s hard for non French speaking children as they can\\'t understand what\\'s going on. My three children (5,8,10) did the \\'wannabe\\' activities among others but felt left out and confused for a lot of it as the instructors didn\\'t speak any English, or just a few words. They were unfortunately the only non-French in their groups. Same with all the instructed activities they did. We were able to guide them for the ones we could watch..but it worried me that they couldn\\'t ask for help or make themselves understood when we weren\\'t there). Luckily they are confident children who do a lot of activities etc and just went with the flow but they didn\\'t learn anything, just copying the other kids etc. Less confident or able children may struggle. I should say that the staff are friendly and apologetic for their lack of English and that if parents are there it\\'s easy enough to muddle through. Now my French is limited to basic holiday French but I do try, along with props (menus, brochure etc) and google translate if needed, not to use English. It therefore bothers me when restaurant staff completely ignore that I\\'m clearly NOT fluent and speak rapidly in French back at me.  I am a guest making an effort, meet me half way!!  I know it must be frustrating but this is a tourist resort so it should be a given not everyone is fluent.  Some of the staff at the Suzette creperie are rude and unfriendly.  We were told it didn\\'t open until 11am for food. So at 10.30am we ordered drinks (at bar, no table service, but was asked for table number) and waited. At 11.15am after watching new tables arrive and get served I asked the waitress if we could order. She told me not until noon. I explained I was told 11am at the bar..she went inside to check...never came out again....I went to the bar to explain and was told yes we could order but it was table service...I said fairly definitely that I\\'d like to order at the bar as the waitress wouldn\\'t come to my table and when I asked her she wouldn\\'t take my order. So a waiter came to the bar to take my order...the crepes were delicious. No apology or explanation, so when the bill arrived I explained that I needed to discuss with the manager what the problem was. No one came...so eventually I went back into the bar to thank them for the delicious crepes but that I wouldn\\'t be paying for the drinks since I was so unhappy with the service. The lady just said something at me in French in an unfriendly tone) took the cash I offered and walked away. Rude and dismissive. A French lady sitting in the table next to us, and watched everything, told me (in perfect English) that she had a similar problem and the (French) table behind were also grumbling.  So I can conclude it wasn\\'t my wonky French that upset them!  But we have noticed that we do generally get left waiting a lot longer than other tables, waiters never return to clear plates, check on us or take dessert orders etc, we usually have to pay the bill as we\\'re walking out and I wonder if it\\'s because they are worried about interacting with non-French speaking guests as it takes longer or they might not understand?  We spend about EUR 150/200 a day on food and drink here but actually I don\\'t want to use the restaurants and eateries again as we just feel unwelcome. We\\'re a happy, friendly family with well behaved kids who love our holidays in France and there\\'s no need for it.  Just also be aware that there is a lot of people smoking, outside seating and outside doors etc. I had a beautiful 120 EUR spa experience but unfortunately the people smoking outside ended it at the door..and I find all the smoking around children at the restaurants unpleasant. I guess the British just aren\\'t accustomed to it anymore. Shame as so much is fantastic but it\\'s left a bad taste in my mouth and I cant say I whole heartedly recommend it for non-French speakers.  If you don\\'t mind fag smoke around your children and your family speaks good French, then I definitely do!

Quick check in. Stayed in a premium cottage which was perfect for 5 of us, plenty of space and clean. Cottages are only 2-3 years old so everything was of a good standard.Only negative with the cottages is the lack of air-conditioning. It was hot when we were there and one of our group ended up sleeping on floor tiles to try and cool down!  Was about a 10 min walk from the water park so we did hire bikes which the kids loved. It\\'s well worth hiring them as it does make getting about much easier.  The water park is fantastic- we spent hours in it every day and we all had a ball! It\\'s much bigger than I appreciated with plenty for all ages. There are life-jackets freely available if you\\'re worried about younger ones which is a good idea especially for the water rapids! The small carrefore supermarket is handy on-site and wasn\\'t too expensive. there are a number of large hypermarkets about 30 mins drive if you want a larger shop. There wasn\\'t pressure to do all the extra activities but we did hire the electric boat which the kids really enjoyed. Also did the adventure course on-site which my daughter really enjoyed. The indoor play area is well designed and laid out and was ideal in the evenings and to avoid the heat at times. Only problem with booking activities was the queue at reception. You weren\\'t able to book online to use the activity tokens we had got with early booking. It seemed a bit quieter in the evenings.

The Italian place was the only one with nice food and good service ! The creperie is a joke and the guy working there is as rude as possible . The spa is nice though expensive but you will actually relax there. All the activities are expensive but they are nice.So overall nice stay shame about the food and the lack of service , clearly the staff doesn\\'t want to be there and it does ruin your stay.

The &quot;areas&quot; where they can be let off leash are minute! Maybe two metres squared! I had to leave the compound every day so as to let her loose, otherwise she would have gone mad with boredom. I understand that animals necessitate cleaning after, but the lack of playgrounds for dogs was just silly.Also quite annoyed by how the men in red welcome us at the entry in a very French manner: no smile, no hello, and they do bite if you ask a question.

Not perfect - dusty in places, broken tin opener and sap on decking. However, none of these are the end of the world and we were generally pleased with the accommodation. Booking activities was as we expected - expensive with a queue to get booked.  We knew what we were going to and I accept this is what you get at CP.The pros - newish centerparcs, great Aquamundo and deer abound. There are some really nice features here such as the nature trail, the hangout and the fish you can dive to see in the swimming pool. On the whole the site is clean and well set out. Staff on the activities were friendly and helpful.The bad bits - I was unfortunate enough to slip while at Aquamundo and end up in A&amp;E needing stitches. While the pool area was slippy I accept that it\\'s no more slippy than some other pools I\\'ve been to and there are signs everywhere to say that CP can\\'t take responsibility for injuries, etc.  As such I make no complaint about this - it\\'s just an unfortunate accident. To rub salt into the wound - whilst at A&amp;E we left our bikes in private car park A (locked together). Upon returning to the car park with stitches we found our two adult bikes stolen and our sons bike remaining. I reported this immediately to security. Again, as annoying as this is I accept that there are bad people about and CP can\\'t control and vet everyone who stays with them. The bit I have a problem with is our treatment following these issues. We wasted until after 2pm waiting for security to come as promised the next day (they said they would also report to police). They didn\\'t turn up despite our checking at reception \\'several\\' times to make sure we were meant to be staying in our apartment. In the end they changed their story saying we are meant to go to the police station ourselves. We would have done that if they hadn\\'t told us to wait in all morning. CP tried to put this down to the language barrier. My wife teaches French and mine is reasonable. There were no language issues! When I involved management the reception staff told barefaced lies about the information they had given us.

Arrival and check in very easy. Cottage very clean. We have stayed in Longleat, Whinfell, Holland and France now and find the European Parcs so much better value with regards to accommodation especially as we have to holiday in peak times - when in Holland we were able to stay in VIP accommodation for a lot less money than a basic villa in the UK.  There seems to be more of a hike in price as in the UK Parcs during school holidays! Staff very accommodating and polite my daughter had an accident and the first aider was very good with her.  A little disappointing that you could not access the animal area as you could in Holland where you had free reign to interact with the animals. Buffet restaurant very disappointing considering the cost \\u20ac25 for adults with not great quality food or choice really - could learn a few lessons from various uk buffet chains. Lots of choice with regards to activities  -  \\u20ac16 for a 3 hour animal keeper activity which my daughter really enjoyed, \\u20ac11 for zip wires and tree top climbing activity which took around a hour was great fun.  Swimming pool could have longer opening hours as with any centre Parcs it can be incredibly busy during the day and we were unable to get on the activity where you can access the swimming pool later at night (at extra cost).  Free activities offered which was good.  It was not an issue with the language we were able to get by in both countries.  It was nice to be away and have the sun!  The Loire Valley was beautiful and close to some lovey places - would recommend visiting Chinnon, Angers, Tours and Samur preferably in the morning as gets very hot and a lot of shops etc close mid day to early afternoon.

The terraced bungalows are spacious and modern.Of course we missed a few elements that we were used to from hotels such as kids clubs, games, evening entertainment program and the seafront - all sadly missing.The domed area outside of the pool felt like a shopping centre, and not a cheap one either.

Some healthy and affordable snack bars wouldn\\'t go amiss.There are other activities here - all additional cost : tree climbing, paintball, water sports....

Before we arrived, I planned the activities via the my centre parcs online but they aren\\'t all book able with this so I had to call, at first i couldn\\'t get through but I tried first thing in the morning and kept calling, when I did get through they were really helpful and spent a long time to help me and book everything. They spoke very good English on the phone and throughout our stay. If they didn\\'t speak good English on the activities, generally we picked it up and it was fine. (This was only the case on the Pony ride and Archery) Arrival We did have a few complications with the sat nav directions, we all had different sat nav built in to the cars and each one (same details) took us to a different place, none of which were correct. We followed signage as soon as we spotted it but the signs are few and far between! (We also split the drive over two days each way, It really limited our time here, I would suggest careful route planning if you do this)We checked in with a convoy of 3 cars, it was very straight forward check in and drove to find our cottage. The CottageWe arrived at 7pm and the cottage was made up and very clean, it had a large living area, we loved that we could all sit together, inside and out and not just at the table, the sofa area is also large. The kitchen was well stocked with all utensils and we even had a juicer. The fridge was huge, which was well needed as we stopped in Le Mans on the way to get our food, (worth noting that on our way home we spotted a supermarket 30 mins away but I couldn\\'t find that one prior to the trip for planning, also wasn\\'t big enough for our large group.) if you are planning on cooking there, be warned there is no Oven! It has a microwave oven but it\\'s no good to cook for this many people as you would in an oven, however we cooked using the hobs and this was ok, just something to bear in mind. The sink is also tiny but we had a dishwasher. Lots of lovely bathrooms and the rooms are great sizes. We had Jacuzzi baths, a steam room and a Sauna, all great fun and a lovely plus. If you have people needing a rest, be aware that you can hear noises, obviously they are wooden and we just had to be mindful of this. We didn\\'t select a disabled cottage but found the wheelchair user was able to access the house, she can however walk some steps, I don\\'t think it would be suitable if you needed to navigate the entire cottage with a wheelchair. We stayed in 902 and it was close to everything.By the second day my daughter had managed to convince the deer her carrots were for them and every morning they came back, they were very friendly and a great plus to the visit. The centre and activitiesThe centre is beautiful and always very clean, it was very calming and picturesque. We didn\\'t use the restaurants except the creperie and that was very tasty, the lady was very helpful, she didn\\'t speak much English but we were in France! So we spoke what French we knew and pointed. They have a great indoor play area and the outdoor play area\\'s were also great. They farm area is small but still lovely and you can go in with some of the animals. We had booked a lot of activities but glad we did as not many were available after we arrived, I did add on Pony riding and one person to the aqua slide.  The high ropes are really challenging but great fun, the little ones did the smaller version and this was equally great fun for them. We also tried Mini golf, Tennis, Archery, paint balling and Segway. The kids club, I booked both my daughters 4 &amp; 10 in for a wannabe day but it was too small for my 10year old although advertised as up to 12. The 4year old went in and loved it although left there and surrounded by French kids. They made a big deal about having a token to collect your child although when it finishes and they came out to do the show and went back in they had left one child outside!!!! Bikes are great and each one has a lock attached, I\\'d recommend the women\\'s bike for women and the mountain bike for the men, I originally started with a mountain bike and it was not great! The bikes make it a lot easier to get to everything and they hire the little cart things for young ones. The Aqua Mundo (swimming pool) The swimming pool is so clean and fantastic, the different areas are incredible, there was so much to do. The slides varied from suitable for toddlers right up to extreme slides. They had climbing walls along side one pool, fish in tanks within one pool, wave pools, splash areas, jacuzzi, Rapids and an outdoor pool, with lots of outdoor seating. However the wheelchair user could only access the pool if she was in her swimming costume, she isn\\'t confident enough to try swimming but would have liked to have watched. The activities were an extreme version of things that were accessible at normal swimming times, my kids and the dads loved them (I would suggest confident swimmers) and would highly recommend doing them. The spa is amazing! We ordered the package online for two of us and on the second day we struggled to get the booking in but they did their best and got us in, everyone was very friendly and helpful, the spa was 5* and the treatments were great. The facilities were really calming and if you can I\\'d definitely recommend it. The check out is early! 10am although you can stay there for the day we stayed until 1pm as we had two activities but struggled to leave with 12 people at 10am! If we went back I\\'d stay for 7 days to really make use of everything whilst also relaxing. For half the price of the U.K. and being able to go in the summer holidays, it was all round a great holiday.

In the end, our third \\'dolce vita\\' coffee machine worked. ( we had bought the pods in advance !) No dvd player, but there\\'s a good bluetooth speaker for sounds.  No gas or charcoal bbqs allowed on site (sensibly), but you can hire an electric on for 10E per night.  Outside furniture is nicely arranged on a deck.  Deer were regular evening visitors.The shop on site is well stocked and not criminally overpriced.....except the fresh croissants and pain au chocolate..........they are pricey, tasty but pricey.If you arrive early enough to get unpacked and get the offspring away to the pool you can nip into Loudun and visit L\\'Eclerc to stock up for a few days AND drive to the villa (cottage) to get unloadedAvoid \\'Quick burger\\' if you can.  Their burgers are\\'nt great and they certainly are\\'nt quick.  At around 8E for the equivalent of a big mac the fast food fix for 6 of us soon racked up !Also check the service times for food - especially if you want brekkie after packing up on leaving day......The pool area is really good - the centre of our holiday.  The youngsters loved the daredevil slides and climbing challenges as well as the rapids.  Us oldies had a go too, but gravitated to the outside pool area as we were blessed with good weather.If you fancy the spa experience, maybe ask to have a look around first.  We\\'ve been to UK CP spas and have been more impressed than with that in Bois aux Dames - its nice, but a bit of an extension of the main pool area with less kids and a couple of sauna / steam rooms.The high ropes course went down well, an from our viewpoint on the deck of the Cocoon restaurant it looked good fun.  Public area wi fi was available, but im reliably informed it was slow.  There were very few Pokemon about either apparantly.Wi fi is available in the cottages, at 40E / week for up to 4 devices.We had stopped and \\'done\\' Le Puy du Fou on the way down.  Excellent, and about an hour and a half from CP.  We had a drive to Saumur, Anger &amp; Chinon - all very pleasant.  We had planned on canoe/kayak hire on the Loire but saw very little chance to do so.

As the the cottage was for 4 we had a dishwasher which you don\\'t normally get in a comfort. As per another review it is a shame that the cleaning isn\\'t up to scratch. Cottage needed a good Hoover as very dusty in corners, behind doors and under beds etc. However bathroom loo and kitchen were all very clean.  Beds massive and really comfortable. We\\'ve stayed in nearly all the European CPs and this one is good but prefer the ones in Holland and Belgium. Aqua Mundo is great the wall along one of the pools with ropes at the end is great and really entertaining to watch people attempting to complete. We booked breakfast buffet before we came and were disappointed with the choice on offer.  The first morning the coffee machine wasn\\'t working so had to make do with cold drink. Again we have been to much smaller parks where there was far more choice available. Many people have commented on the prices here and it\\'s true it\\'s expensive but all CPs are the same and to be honest it costs far more if you go to the UK parks which is why we avoid them.  I think there is definitely an issue with understaffing. As waits in the restaurant in the Aqua Mundo are ridiculous but the staff are lovely and really try their best.  You just have to get into the groove of being on holiday and chill. We had dinner in the cocoon restaurant and although the menu is limited the food was good, definitely recommend the burger and the ice creams are huge. We had good service and no problem booking a table. We have done some trips out. Chinon Castle is well worth a visit a truly lovely atmospheric place.

We had a comfort cottage well stocked with kitchen equipment lovely layout and as parc is only a year old still in really good condition, nice feature you get your own garden area, our kids played badminton outside most evenings something you don\\'t really get in uk.  The staff were very friendly and helpful some spoke really good English, but we got by on my school girl french and why should we expect everyone to speak English it is France after all !!The action house had a fab indoor and outdoor play area again our kids loved this.

Don\\'t expect a large range of activities, the selection is limited compared to what is available in the uk.  But this wasn\\'t a problem we weren\\'t short on things to do that\\'s for sure.We took our own bikes which makes getting round the large parc a lot quicker.

First tip - park car near cottage to unload. The cottage was in excellent condition and clean. My only gripe was lack of BBQ and there was no oven, just microwave with grill facility (which had no instructions). Also grass at rear of property was slightly overgrown (but this did get mowed towards the end of our stay). Plus side was we got visited everyday by a selection of deer who were very tame and friendly :)The cottages are very modern and roomy. I would have preferred a better seating arrangement in living room, than \\'L\\' shaped bench, but it wasn\\'t a major issue.We had TV in Living room and master bedroom which had BBC1 &amp; BBC2. However these channels didn\\'t seem to work on our TV in bedroom. Again wasn\\'t a major problem.Now onto the good stuff...First time to Center Parcs, so wasn\\'t sure what to expect, but boy I was pleasantly surprised. The Aqua Mundo was amazing with so much to appease all ages. As the weather was good we tended to station our family of four (two daughters aged 11 &amp; 9) outside. There was always plenty of sunbeds and chairs available. All of us had a ball on the water rides and the temperature of the pool was lovely at 30 degrees. Getting around, the hiring of bikes was a godsend and due to the size of the complex, I would say a certainty. It was lovely to explore the park on the bikes and girls loved riding around in the safety of a no car environment (which is a huge plus).On the activity front we did the middle Aerial course (for children under 1.45m). It was good, but as previously written in reviews was a little pricey.With regards to food - I would say my review was mixed. You seemed to have a wide range of restaurants. We ate in the Crepe House, buffet and italian and all were good standard. The negative again would be the price - it is above average as was the supermarket costs, but I suppose this is the price you pay for the convenience of it being based onsite.On the staffing front, I found nearly all of them to be very pleasant and accommodating. Majority did speak a little English, but should you really expect this? They did seem a little light in Burger bar and around pool areas though.Overall, we had a fantastic time.

Our reference points are Center Parcs Woburn, Elveden and Lac d\\'Ailette in France.Headline - in my view, this is the best Center Parcs we have been to. Tips:1. It\\'s about 5-6hrs from Calais Eurotunnel, easy drive. I bought a toll tag from Sanef Tolling (search sanef tolling on google) to make the drive easier - register, clip onto windscreen and cruise through the tolls. Check-in to Center Parcs online and pick up your keys at security. 2. We usually go for a 3 bed cottage, but this time there wasn\\'t a huge difference in the price for a 4 bed lodge. If you\\'re able to - do it. It was huge, modern and a great space to relax in with steam room and sauna. 3. About the cottage - there is no traditional oven - just a combi thing that isn\\'t easy to operate and the instructions aren\\'t helpful. Don\\'t be like us and buy anything frozen from the shop and try and cook it. There is no DVD player in the cottage like other CPs. On the plus side - deer often walk by and hang out in the garden. 4. We brought scooters instead of bikes - perfectly fine, if a little bumpy. I usually hire one bike with a carriage (Chariot in French) which is very handy for carting stuff about.5. I read a lot about bad service on previous reviews - my experience was very different. First of all, yes it\\'s an international brand - but you are in France. Make an attempt to speak some French - please, thank you, no matter how bad you think you sound. French waiters and waitresses are not related to the American breed. They will not wait on your every move - you have to politely assert yourself to get their attention, smile, greet them in French and order. If you sit there waiting...you will be waiting a long time (I used to live in France and did a lot of waiting).6. The whole place feels much newer than all other CPs (except Woburn). The pool is probably the best one - a lot of variety (e.g. underwater aquarium, lazy river, climbing wall as well as the usual slides). Key heights for kids are 1.2m and 1.4m and aged 8 for the outdoor rapids (that they are fast particularly near the end)7. There was a local market on the Saturday to buy regional produce. The local Carrefour was great, well stocked, didn\\'t feel overpriced. Restaurants fine - kids loved the dessert section of the Jungle buffet. The others were ok, just ok. Center Parcs Woburn better for restaurants. 8. Booking for all activities did indeed require queuing up, but the staff were super efficient and spoke perfect English. Random point - If you go bowling and have young kids - remember to specify you want bumpers up when you input their names on the screen.9. Don\\'t rely on the \\'room service\\' delivery. We were quoted 2 hrs wait for a pizza. 10. There aren\\'t enough parking spaces for each cottage.

As an English family we didn\\'t feel overly welcomed at most places. Bikes with and without the trailers were great. Information / activity booking staff were most helpful. The staff in most of the restaurants were unhelpful and rude at times. To be honest I think they are understaffed, possibly undertrained and stressed out. Unfortunately the service you receive can make or break a holiday. Having said that, my children had such an amazing time in the pool areas and myself and my husband on the flumes. The deer, the cottage, swimming, Mini golf, ponies, farm and electric boats were fab, but the customer service really lets this place down. Also as it\\'s rather new the plants between the cottages haven\\'t grown much yet so not as much privacy in your garden as there will be once they\\'ve grown.

For a small family with an older child (11), the park was fantastic and we had an action-packed and exhausting week. We chose Bois Aux Daims because it was the newest park, so it would be interesting to see how good it looks in a few years, but at the moment it\\'s all still pristine. Some specific comments on various elements. 1. It\\'s a commercial enterprise, and that\\'s very apparent when you are there. Don\\'t expect anything for free except the Aqua Mundo. Some of the activities are eye-wateringly expensive - \\u20ac24 a head for a treetop parkour adventure, \\u20ac32 for an hour of bowling, etc. quickly adds up if you have more than one child with high expectations for entertainment. 2. Activities booking is chaotic and requires lengthy queuing. Do whatever you possibly can ahead of arriving. It\\'s a shame CP haven\\'t put this online as it would be much better to be able to book time slots ahead of arriving. 3. You\\'re in France - don\\'t expect to everyone to speak English. We muddled by quite happily for the most part with a smattering of 20-year-old school French, but struggled on a couple of occasions with very specific problems.4. The spa is lovely, but see point 1. I paid \\u20ac125 ahead of time for a relax and massage package, and expected for that money to also get use of the spa facilities, but it was just treatments - \\u20ac28 extra for 2 hours in the aqua balneo. 5. We had a comfort cottage (basic) which was plenty of room for the 3 of us, and to be honest we were out most of the time. But it wasn\\'t terribly clean - very dusty in places, toys left by previous occupants under beds and behind the curtains in the living room. Only one pillow each too which is the opposite of comfort for me...6. It was 30 degrees most days and the cottages warm up fast and retain it. Most nights were unpleasantly hot even with the windows open. No air conditioning. 7. Smoking! It\\'s allowed all over the park which was a shame. As a Brit I\\'m not used to it anymore and didn\\'t enjoy walking or cycling through it. 8. The aqua mundo is the highlight of the park. Fabulous slides and crazy fun savage river which we did over and over. Beware weekends though when it\\'s full of day trippers (again, see point 1...) - real shame as it\\'s no fun when it\\'s that crowded. You can pay extra for a nighttime experience where they stick a helmet on you and let you do the slides head first - they boys loved it so would recommend it for the thrill seekers. 9. We ate out twice - once at Cocoon and once at Giardino. Both very good but quite slow service. Booking tables is necessary in the evening, but can only be done by phone on a central number and they don\\'t always pick up. 10. Onsite Carrefour - others have mentioned it being overpriced. I didn\\'t notice a vast difference between most items sold there or in outside supermarkets, but it doesn\\'t carry a huge range and queues were often long, so would recommend taking shopping in with you rather than relying on buying everything there. 11. Limited open space. There is a \\'hangout\\' with football goals etc, but more often than not it was taken over by teenagers, and our 11-year-old wasn\\'t comfortable there. There\\'s a missed opportunity to have a nice open communal grassy area where families could sit or play and kids could make friends. 12. Don\\'t plan to cook anything that needs an oven. The cottage has a combi microwave oven thing but it barely melted cheese on the oven setting. Meals that only require the hob are the way forward!", "title": "Good but make sure you plan before you go...", "rating": "4", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/a8/31/8b/center-parcs-domaine.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Bois aux Daims", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Route des Trois Moutiers", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Nouvelle-Aquitaine", "postalCode": "86120", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "August 10, 2016", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " August 2016"},

We booked a VIP 6 person lodge, which was fantastic.

We didn\\'t book before we arrived and a lot of the bikes were already gone but they have a lot of bikes and it cost us 80\\u20ac for our 3 childrens bike for a week, which wasn\\'t too bad and they used them the whole time, The whole park is very clean and well maintained with lots of activities for all the family. You can book activities when you arrive or each day if you prefer.  We did the high adventure trail with zip wire, electric boats, segways, archery, mini golf. The activities were reasonably priced and lots to choose from.The aqua mundo which is free is amazing, with lots of slides, rapids and different pools. The children wanted to go there most days. It was very clean and the water was warm. Our accommodation had 3 bedrooms, which were lovely. The lounge/dining area was fantastic and had patio doors which slid open to the large decking area. We had visits most days from the deer which was fantastic.  It was nice to sit outside having breakfast, lunch and dinners. We tended to have lunch after swimming at the quick takeaway/restaurant which the children loved as you could get kids meals with toys, a bit like Mcdonalds but much much better, and dinners were usually outside on our decking. There is an on site carremor shop which stocked a good variety of food and drinks.

Firstly, the prices on site are insane. I hate when companies have a captive audience so ramp the prices up. Step outside the park and go to a local supermarket and everything was at least 1/3 cheaper to buy. It wasn\\'t as if the products (food and drink) on offer warranted the higher prices. Things were nice... but not outstanding and worth the extra cost. It all felt a little like trying to squeeze as many Euros out of you as possible.Secondly, although our cottages was beautiful there was one major flaw in the bathroom. No anti-slip mats. So I had four children, two showers and a tiled floor.... recipe for disaster. You\\'d have thought that given this place is a 5 leafy bird (Star) resort, to provide anti-slip mats as standard would have been a given. Two of my children slipped and fell fortunately avoiding major injury.Generally the park is very clean, tidy and well presented. Staff generally were friendly however some places were very understaffed, although this could be due to it being early in the season. We saw the same staff working in a lot of the restaurants and sometimes had to wait a long time to be served as there never seemed to be enough staff available.Generally we had a good time and the children loved the activities.One huge plus point... the pool is AMAZING! and thankfully totally free! it has plenty to offer, loads of seating, inside and outside areas and a great kids area for the toddlers.", "title": "Some Good some Bad", "rating": "3", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/a8/31/8b/center-parcs-domaine.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Bois aux Daims", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Route des Trois Moutiers", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Nouvelle-Aquitaine", "postalCode": "86120", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "August 8, 2016", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " July 2016"},

The site itself - our first Centerparcs - looks like a cross between Butlins/Hi de Hi/ and The Great Escape/Chicken Run - no sign of Steve Mcqueen/Ginger though and there were no tunnels being dug but the guards on the gate were a little feisty.  Being flat, the site was great for the good quality hire bikes - why does any one, unless they have mobility issues, bother with renting a golf cart? A great sense of space - in spite of the 900+ sheds (sorry Cottages) The site itself is a little bit spartan - although this will change as the heavily planted (albeit a bit scrub-like)  landscape matures - some of the huts (sorry Cottages) are a little bit exposed - do study the site map to chose your location.  The tree house accommodation did look good but bears more than a passing resemblance to the alien machines in War of the Worlds. The site is well sign-posted and well lit a night - it feels safe, secure and not crowdedThe accommodation - a Premium lodge/cottage/shed/hutch for six. The only disappointment was the lack of air conditioning - perhaps a sign of getting on a bit as a guest, everything else was fine; clean modern, reasonably well equipped but don\\'t bother with the Dulce Gusto machine and just buy real coffee for the filter machine or instant coffee.  The dish washer takes about six (!) hours to get anywhere near cleaning the dishes and doesn\\'t seem to like dissolving dishwasher tablets. The kitchen was well equipped, everything was clean, and enough bathrooms/toilets to go round.  The showers aren\\'t great and you do have to run around a bit under them to get wet but plenty of hot water. Our phone didn\\'t work which could be very frustrating as restaurant reservations (recommended) are only allowed via phone; we had to go to ten yards away from the restaurant to use a phone to make the reservation!!Facilities on site are good, booking in advance is the best idea but does not prevent cancellations - we had Aqua Speed cancelled (a common theme) but were refunded and given free wi-fi as compensation (it should be free anyway really) - it is in the main building so it could be good to have the accommodation wi-fi less by way of respite.  Staff at reception were really helpful but go to reception first thing in the morning - 0900 - as otherwise it will be busy.The pool/Aqua Mundo is OK but not that \\'classy\\' - it really felt like a good municipal pool complete with a maze of lockers that needs to be negotiated before you find your way in to the pool - (you don\\'t get those at Mark Warner!). The corridor outside the pool smelt of blocked toilets - not terribly pleasant but a brief distraction. Lots for children of all ages to do but beware - apparently you can only sit by the pool if you\\'re wearing swimming costumes (no other attire will do and wearing nothing is not an option - even for the Dutch) - I\\'m not sure why - and no shoes allowed which can be a bit dodgy when the whole of the outside area is laid with black stone which is like walking on hot coals - unless this was some kind of Gwyneth Paltrow beauty treatment - unlikely as there would have been a charge for this.The \\'eateries\\' were fine - service patchy but you\\'re on holiday and it beats waiting back in your cabin (sorry Cottage) for the dishwasher to finish.The place is good, still feels vaguely like being \\'abroad\\', very clean, very pleasant, and does what it says on the tin.", "title": "Still expensive for what it is", "rating": "3", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/a8/31/8b/center-parcs-domaine.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Bois aux Daims", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Route des Trois Moutiers", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Nouvelle-Aquitaine", "postalCode": "86120", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "August 1, 2016", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " July 2016"},

There is also a soft play area for crawlers/ new walkers and then a big area for older kids in the Action Factory. They also have free entertainment for kids in the late afternoon/evening. It is in French, but all activities were inclusive and they did speak English if you asked. They also have free animal trails and a little farm which is also free. We loved the free element of these as in the UK it feels like everything except the pool you have to pay extra for. We rode our bikes a lot. They also hire bikes, but we brought our own with a child seat. We ate in the pizza place and cocoon restaurants. They were ok, but nothing to write home about. We did order food to cook in the cottage and we drove the 20 minutes to the supermarket to stock up on supplies. We brought a BBQ with us and used that a few nights. They do have a BBQ package where you can hire the BBQ and they deliver it alongside your food. The kitchen doesn\\'t have an oven - so that limits what you can cook. I would recommend the Crepery though, very yummy!!We did two trips to Samur and Angers which were a nice break away from the park. Our only big issue was that it was a warm week. The cottages do not have air con or fans. The bedroom did not get below 25 degrees even though we had the bedroom window opens the whole week. The main spaces didn\\'t have air con or fans either - the action factory did get very warm with all the kids running around. Another smaller issue was that they do not have any washing facilities on site.

After a traumatic trip up with a sick child a cleaner kindly let us in to the cottage early, I did not realise you could not get in to the cottage until 3pm even if they are cleaned and ready. I was really disappointed there were no laundry facilities, I under stand there being no facilities in the cottage but I would have paid good money to have our clothes cleaned or to take them to a laundrette on site. Aqua Mundo was good, plenty to do but was slightly ruined by the glue fumes, we had to leave one of the days as it was unbearable. Also the pool area was too cold on a lot of the days, my 1 year old did not want to stay long due to this. I found it extremely busy at the weekend too with day trippers, we ended up leaving the pool on the Saturday as there was no where to sit or play. We were on a half board package, we ate breakfast at the Buffett restaurant which was exactly the same food every day, the cooked breakfast was inedible (watery scrambled eggs, over cooked mini sausages, greasy fatty bacon ect)We had breakfast delivered on a couple of morning which made a nice change, they also send plenty of tea/coffee/milk. The food in the Buffett restaurant in the evenings wasn\\'t particularly nice either. The food at the Italian was lovely, we really enjoyed it. We ate at cocoon twice for dinner, this was a bit hit and miss one night was great the other no so good, they do a good burger though. The on site shop was great, really well stocked. None of use spoke particularly good French (only what we learnt at school!) we seemed to get by okay, but found it helpful using a translation app on our phone as around 50% of staff we spoke to didn\\'t speak English.  All of the literature was in French too, maybe a multi lingual brochure would be helpful as we found in challenging one night trying to order food for delivery as the person we were trying to order from did not speak any English and the brochure was in French too. We hired bikes, they were great fun and worth every penny. Defiantly a must to get around the park. The soft play area was great, my daughter absolutely loved it.My favourite thing about this place was the deer, it was so nice seeing them wonder through your garden, a few of them even came up to us to say hello. We also went to a zoo which was a 30 minute drive from here call Bioparc, this place was amazing (set in an old quarry) we even got to stroke a giraffe, well worth a visit as 7 days inside the park can get a bit monotonous.

It was our first time in a CP so were not sure what to expect.  We have 3 children aged 10, 7 and 3.  Last year our then 9 year was bored on a sun holiday so we thought we would try something different this year (with more activities etc..) and he just loved this holiday.The accommodation:We stayed in a 6 bed premium eden cottage on a corner plot.  The cottage was very spacious, very comfortable, lovely outdoor space and we ate our breakfast outside most mornings.  The cottage had everything you could need (except maybe a washing machine).All the things we loved about our stay:-very good quality and good standard accommodation-deer roam freely and come into your garden-lots of activities for the kids to do- my 2 youngest kids loved the Action factory - the indoor play area.  The attention to detail in here as well is fantastic, the theme is childrens fairy tales, if you look at the walls you can see the 3 pigs looking through windows, one with straw, one with bricks and one with sticks, on another wall there is a window high up with hair coming out of it (raponsel\\'s hair), a dragon with 3 heads somewhere else etc...great attention to detail.-we hired bikes and they were well worth the money.  My 10 year old loved cycling everywhere and it is a nicer and faster way to get around-as one of the slides is closed we were given 50 euro credit on arrival-the wrist bands are fantastic, they open your cottage, open and lock the lockers in the pool and can also be used as a credit card /you can put money on them to pay for your meals and drinks etc.. very handy-kids under 4 eat free so we did not have to pay for my 3 year old in any restaurant-the site is very well organised, each area has its own car park and while there are over 900 houses in total you do not feel that there are many people around at all.  There are several different areas, each with their own car park and then obviously not so many houses in each area.-we paid for 4 evening meals online before we left.  It cost 19.90 per adult for 3 courses, when we got on site most of the menus were 24.90 but our online vouchers covered these so it worked out cheaper to buy the vouchers.-if you have a baby the cottage had lots of extra things that would make a stay more enjoyable - for example, a toilet seat for small children, small steps in the bathroom for small kids to stand on, mirrors placed lower on the wall for kids to look into...lots of attention to detail.Things that could be improved:-we arrived at 10pm and the premium and comfort cottages have safes that need a lock, the other cottages have safes with codes.  so first thing the next morning we had to go to reception to physically pick up the lock to make the safe work, this also meant that we had to carry around a key the whole time.  Dont know why all safes are not safes with codes, they are much more convenient and saves you carrying around a key the whole time.- reception is always very busy and always longs queues, the staff really take their time with each person!! they are not in a rush by any means...-there was good storage/shelves in the 2 twin bedrooms but NO shelves at all in the master bedroom, there was a small wardrobe with hanging space but NO shelves....-the staff in the restaurants and activities do not speak much english at all, I studied French 30 years ago so we managed but the kids did activities and they could not understand the instructions or what they were meant to do.  The activity staff could easily have a sign with an English translation with instructions and the health and safety information.  This would make the activities much more enjoyable for all especially the children (you cant expect a 3, 7 and 10 year old to be fluent french!)- there seems to be NO First Aid or basic medical training or facilities anywhere.  My son had a bad fall off his bike and his arm was swollen, we knew he did not break any bones but I did want someone to check it and make sure he was ok.  considering how many activities there are, there should be at least one staff on that has First Aid training.-I know most people say that the Aqua Mondeo/pool is the highlight of their stay but it wasnt ours.  I love to swim lengths and there is actually nowhere to SWIM in the pool! yes there are slides and kids areas etc.. but I would have loved to have been able to get a few lengths in as well.Overall we loved our holiday, we would go back again and we would recommend to our friends and family as well.", "title": "June-July 2016", "rating": "5", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/a8/31/8b/center-parcs-domaine.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Bois aux Daims", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Route des Trois Moutiers", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Nouvelle-Aquitaine", "postalCode": "86120", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "July 4, 2016", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " July 2016"},

However, everything was well cooked and the buffet restaurant was good value if you eat a lot and have a party with varying tastes.The rapids were not working, and we received an 80e card due to this, which was a nice gesture.Supermarket is well stocked and reasonably priced unless you want eat which is quite expensive.The only negatives I would state is that there are not many activities for active 6 and 7 year olds. I think CP could really put some more thought into this programme.  The mini golf was absurdly priced (30e for a family of 4!), which we had to do as this was one of the few activities we could do with a 7 year old!The staff are a little inflexible, we arrived 5 mins after the close time for the bikes and were told to come back tomorrow, even though there were still guests being served and we had a pre paid voucher!There is good English spoken here, however some staff can find it difficult to communicate more complex conversations.  However, I am sure CP in UK does not produce multi lingual staff so why would they cater for other languages here?

Over all, we found Le Bois aux Daims to be a fabulous venue to stay at and are already considering another visit next year! We had read that a lot of other people complained that not enough of the staff \\u2018spoke English\\u2019. Well, we are in the middle of France, y\\u2019know! Anyway, armed with my terrible \\u2018O\\u2019 Level French, we arrived and were greeted by a young French woman who almost immediately said \\u2018Would you prefer to speak in English\\u2019 (after listening to me mangling her language, no doubt!). She then very clearly explained where we would find our cottage, where to park, etc. Throughout our entire visit we didn\\u2019t have any problems being understood. Most staff had a good level of English and I only had to call on my French once or twice. Our cottage was very well-appointed and scrupulously clean throughout. It was the \\u2018Premium\\u2019 category and was certainly spacious enough for our family and had everything we needed for our short stay. Also it was lovely to see deer occasionally wander right up to our windows and graze. Unfortunately we were let down by the weather and so were never able to use the cottage\\u2019s attractive patio area \\u2013 but when you choose to holiday in northern Europe so early in the season, it\\u2019s always going to be a risk. Generally, we found the facilities at the Parc to be of a very high standard, and talking to other guests we learned that although this didn\\u2019t seem to offer as many activities as a UK Parc, it was certainly seen as the best one in France. At its heart is the large dome that housed the pool and slides, shops, restaurants and bowling alley. We naturally spent a lot of time in the pool and greatly enjoyed it, although it could have been better if everything had been working (see below). A small \\u2018vortex\\u2019 pool that pulled you along was great fun and made us wish that the Wild River had been working. However, playing in the wave pool, the indoor and heated outdoor pool (despite the rain), slides and rock climbing pool all gave us plenty of things to do. We also enjoyed the pool with the underwater fish tanks, which gave the illusion of swimming alongside large tropical fish!Hiring bikes is certainly necessary, as the entire complex is very big and it would take too long to walk everywhere. Having the bikes in such a beautiful and tranquil location, with virtually no cars, was a lovely and relaxing way to spend time, gently cycling around the complex and wooded areas. Unfortunately, the weather spoiled it slightly. Also the bike maintenance could have been better (see below).My eldest daughter and I also completed the advanced high ropes course. This was very exhilarating and very challenging! It was also exhausting! Although advertised as lasting about 45 minutes, it actually lasted over two hours, including the safety briefing, making it a very worthwhile and fun activity. The other activity that stood out for us was a pedalo trip on the lake. It was very relaxing and enjoyable to gently drift along and take in the views. Before we arrived, we had stocked up at a large E.Leclerc supermarket, nearby in Loudon \\u2013 but the onsite Carrefour supermarket seemed to carry a reasonably wide range of goods. Also, its prices did not seem to be much higher than in any other supermarket. Although having a pick \\u2018n\\u2019 mix sweets section (right by the entrance!) which is sold by weight, with the only scales behind the till, is a bit cheeky, especially as I ended up forking out \\u20ac18 for two moderate bags!So overall, a really great and positive experience \\u2013 but there is certainly room for improvement:\\u2022\\tA charge of \\u20ac25 for Wi-Fi during our stay, limited to only four devices, is a bit of a rip off!\\u2022\\tSome activities were also quite expensive for what they were \\u2013 the mini golf, for example, was \\u20ac30. However, my children really enjoyed the game.\\u2022\\tBikes need to be better maintained. Left outside in all weathers, many were rusty/dirty, while others had broken peddles or locks/gears that had rusted up. While picking out two suitable bikes for my daughters, I had to sort through about six or seven, until I found two that we just about acceptable. \\u2022\\tThe bowling alley needs to be better organised. We had bought a game at the main desk \\u2013 but there was really nothing to stop anyone from wandering in and playing a game for free. The alley seemed to be understaffed and the only staff in there were all occupied serving drinks at the bar. \\u2022\\tIt was only through (many) complaints, listed here on Trip Advisor, that we learned that the Wild River was closed for major redesign work, which would take several months to complete. OK, we also received the \\u20ac10 per person refund for the inconvenience \\u2013 but like so many other people, we did not feel Center Parcs made this fact very clear and could be accused of brushing it under the carpet. Also, one of the four waterslides was also out of order during our visit, which was very disappointing. \\u2022\\tAlthough the booking process online was very straightforward, it was then very difficult to get additional information or clarify any issues prior to arrival. This needs to be improved to help customers get the most from their bookings. For example, we were not sure whether bath towels were included (they weren\\u2019t), so had to pay extra for them. I would ideally like to give this Parc 4\\u00bd out of 5 \\u2013 not 4 \\u2013 but such are the limitations of the site.", "title": "Almost Perfect!", "rating": "4", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/a8/31/8b/center-parcs-domaine.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Bois aux Daims", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Route des Trois Moutiers", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Nouvelle-Aquitaine", "postalCode": "86120", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "June 9, 2016", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " April 2016"},

There is also a seperate pool for toddlers with their own water slide and a pool for babies. The big water slides are great for big kids, but not so much for a 5yr old. The outside pool is much more fun than for example in Les Trois Forets. The only thing that they could improve is a kids area outside. All outside pools in Center Parcs are at least 1m10, I don\\'t get why.The rest of the activities are great and there is a lot to do.

We chose this park because it is practically brand new. We ordered the Eden VIP suite with three bedrooms, which was very nice and modern, as expected for CP. We even had the pleasure of visiting deer in our backyard, which was just lovely. The dome seemed smaller than other parks, but the Aqua Mundo was a nice size, together with the big pool, baby pool (with two baby slides and sand area), another small pool, outdoor pool, water gymboree (with 4 kids slides) and water slides. Unfortunately the Wild River was under construction, which we just learned about upon arriving. While it was disappointing to hear, we did appreciate the monetary compensation. And we very much enjoyed ourselves the first day at the pool. What we did not appreciate, however, was that the next day we entered the Aqua Mundo and felt a burning sensation in our eyes. It turned out that this was due to glue/adhesive that the workers were using for repairing the Wild River. We tried going to another part of the pool to avoid it, but it was unbearable and left after an hour. When we approached the staff about it, they were aware of the problem and offered to compensate us with an activity. We were more concerned about not encountering this problem again, as the Aqua Mundo is the highlight of our stay. Unfortunately the next day we smelled the glue again, albeit not as strong, but we couldn\\'t enjoy ourselves for too long. Apparently the workers were supposed to work during the night, when the pool is not open, but they decided to work during the day instead. This was quite the blunder. Luckily they took care of the problem on the last day. We tried not to let the glue issue ruin our vacation, because otherwise we enjoyed our stay. The Action Factory was great for both our kids and took advantage of going there often.

We have been to a couple of uk centre parcs but thought we would try one in France. Would definitely go back. Stayed in a tree house which if you can, I would recommend. Is in a great position and of excellent design. Only aspect that is slightly odd is that restaurants don\\'t open until 7. This includes take away delivery (earliest delivery is 730 I think).Therefore, if you have a young family (like I do) and go out, you will unlikely be eating much before 730 which would be near to bed time for my 3 and 1 year old. There is a good little store on sight that is good enough to get a weeks food from.The staff I met were all excellent. Very helpful everywhere I went. Might be worthwhile brushing up on your French but would get by OK if did not speak much French as main reception and a few other areas speak very good English. Obviously the children would be limited with activities such as forest walks and cooking classes as these would be in French.Lastly, no fault of centre parcs but my 3 years old balance bike got stolen. We left it for about 10 minutes whilst walking in the forest and came back and it had gone (locked others). Unfortunately, we couldn\\'t warn the thief but the front wheel falls off after a five minutes of use so we would regularly have tools to tighten it as when it loosens it really comes straight off. It was coming up to retirement but was sad to explain to my boy that it had been stolen whilst he walked home. In a way, I like to think it has been properly fixed and is now being enjoyed in France.Thanks to the centre parcs team and we hope to come back next year.

On arrival had lots of confusion as to where our keys were picked up from as we got waved through by a member of staff instead of waiting at the gate to collect our details but this was all down to a language issue which could be resolved with little issue if instructions bit clearer and all staff spoke a little english although I did muddle through with my school french and a phrase book. Our cottage was well located(number 845) ,about 4 mins walk to aqua mundo and the dome.The restaurants were very good, tried them all but we did have issues with  the supermarket in that they had fridges breaking down and not much availability of things like fresh milk, so would definitely advise bringing the basics if nothing else. We were compensated before we arrived with 40 euros due to one of the water rides not being open but with so much else to do in the aqua mundo we never noticed or missed it.

There is so much free stuff to do as well it really does have everything. The only thing i would say is that being in france everything does seem to work on slower time,ie there are days when things are not open or open for couple of hours, which means you have to plan your day around this or just take the attitude of the french and relax!!this was fine for us having older children but could see it being a problem with younger ones.

It was as expected with some pleasant and unpleasant surprises.The unpleasant one:- It is huge! so if you do not want to walk 5 to 10min minimum from your cottage to the activities, then this is not for you. Cycling or renting a electric car is a must to really enjoy the parc I think. This was not our case (mistake of beginners) and we struggled to go around especially under the rainy weather- The restaurant services (we tried the pizzeria, the pancakes place both bar and restaurant, the Bali bar and the Quick), at all places sucks. Sorry to say that, but I think this is a common thing of most of the French restaurant (sorry but I am French). Not enough waiters, so you end up with unpleasant waiters going around like crazy, and still you have to wait a long time to get anything, if you manage to get something. Actually at the pancake restaurant we did even get served as after 10minutes, nobody came to get us at the entrance point, and even sitting at the bar, after 20min the waitress came (too late) as we were just there to wait to goto an activity- the archery is very expensive (17 euros per person) for just 30 min. The lady was not even very nice, and she was rushing through all the explanation.- if you don;t book your activities before your arrival, it will be full. We did not know this, and once there a lot of activities we wanted to do were either fully booked or not at very convenient time. So yes you can do a lot of things, but the slots are quite limited, so you better be quick to book them- queue at the reception to book everything (another French consequence of reducing service staff)- the directions to arrive there are very difficult to find. Don\\'t know why. No indication at all on the road. We had to use google earth to navigate around as the maps were not yet updated. It was not even mentioned in the town just next door.The pleasant surprises:- the check in is virtually inexistant! you arrive with your booking in hand and you are handover your key and everything without leaving your vehicle- the cottage are far better than expected. We had a hamman and jacuzzi, and it is very big. Not a cramped accommodation where they try to put as many people as possible. Really nice to relax beside the fire place. The furniture was good quality. The bed were very confortable- the deers on our back yard! the second morning, around 10am, about 10 deers beside to pass quietly in front our huge window. Amazing to see few few meters away! the kids were shooting inside and they did not bother, so I guess the noise insulation was very good. And you can see deer regularly inside the domain- the pool is fantastic with the water at 30degC even outside when it is 5degC. It was very surprising to swim outside when it is so cold and being so warm.- The service at the pool was very nice, complete opposite of the restaurant waiters (I guess because of safety regulation they must keep enough staff at the pool and therefore they are much more relax and pleasant)- the domain inside the forest is very nice, protected and safe for the kids to play around- It is huge! a lot of path to go walking and cycling safely Overall, a very pleasant 3 nights there with one full day of rain (as we expected).

We arrived to be greeted by deer wandering freely and were really pleased with our cottage, clean and fresh, and a good size for the 4 of us.  Sadly the last room I checked was the wc, which was dirty!  However in my basic French I found a member of staff who cleaned it straight away and we were all sorted in 5 minutes.  We never received our kitchen pack, even after reporting it missing but that wasn\\'t the end of the world. We then got on with our holiday.  Our children aged 9 and 4 did a huge selection of activities. The pool was a huge hit and in the week wasn\\'t too busy at all (5 min queue at most for the big ones that were open, some are closed at the moment) and it was easy to spend 2-3 hours.  Staff were constantly cleaning and there were big family changing rooms and lockers where you use your wristband - so easy!  Weekends were more crowded.  The children did the high tree adventure, pony ride, padaloe and some kids activities.  The staff were at least dual language and the kids enjoyed them.  The play centre was great.  Food was good, we had a breakfast basket delivered everyday, and used the baguettes for lunch with cheese and meat from the supermarket.  We ate in the pizza restaurant and creperie, both really good, staff friendly, menus dual language but as always attempting French was appreciated.  Kids meals were really good!  The cottage kitchen has good facilities, but no oven, worth knowing!  We didn\\'t find it a problem. We found staff to be friendly and were able to book activities for the next day with no problem.  It\\'s a shame uk guests cannot use the app.  All in all, a fantastic time and no more uk centre parc for us!  We would go back and are keen to try other European parcs too.

Beautiful design, quite stunning, very lovely cottages and environmentally brilliant. Great swimming complex and wonderful high level playgrounds for both children and adults. ( Thanks to Claudia from my grandson) Nice aviary and sweet farm. We were very happy what our cottage and its perfect facilities, charming cleaner. However it took us 20 minutes to get in at midday as we had to queue just to get a welcome pack, maybe unnecessarily. Going out 2 hours later  to pick up the rest of our family the queue was 3 times long, so people would have waited for an hour.  As we left on the final day, the queue was even longer, quite shameful, maybe 1 1/2 hours just to get in .The restaurants are few and the choice average at best, with poor service and endless queuing. At The Cocoon my green beans arrived cold after 3 reminders after I had finished my main course. It took 2 reminders to get our sparkling water. My son\\'s meal arrived after chasing 4 times when all the rest of us had finished our meals and had to wait. Not the fault of our waitress but the kitchen I think. But how assertive do you have to be to eat ?Also on site we tried to order crepes but were ignored and eventually left. Elsewhere it took 15 minutes to get ice creams.To book activities took endless long queues with not enough staff or not all  staff present seemed to be working. Extremely frustrating in such a beautiful place.The names and photos of senior staff are displayed but where are they? Not visible at all in sorting our this shambles.

We spent time with friends and this made for a most enjoyable trip but there are definitely some things to watch out for at this park.... Aqua Mundo has a variety of activities but the external water is colder than other parks.  There are long queues at the slides and the water rapids are absolutely packed at all times.  The water rapids in this park are narrow, packed  and very fast.  All eight of party suffered significant bruising, skin scrapes and other injuries with 2 adults and 1 child suffering cuts, bruising and swollen nasty bangs to the head.  Look around at other people!!  They all have  injuries its easy to see!  So be warned.The spa was very basic with 1 steam room, 1 internal sauna, 1 external sauna and a salt room.  The swimming pool and jacuzzi were cold!!   colder than the water in the main Aqua Mundo part.  We left earlier than the 2 hours we had paid for - who wants to sit and relax in cold water?!!The changing rooms were always busy, sometimes with queues of people standing cold and waiting to dress. The floors were generally  wet with puddles to dress in as as well as not particularly clean (not gross but just not great either).  The showers were either not working or freezing  and I mean freezing.  Generally only 3 or 4  out of about 20 were working and warm at any one time.No proper oven. Not a massive deal, just microwave with grill and a hob.  The park restaurants nice but expensive but annoyingly closed between 2pm and 7pm!!  Strange with such a captive hungry audience but be prepared as if you have tired young kids its not always suitable to have dinner at this time in the evening and if you end up in your lodge its a microwave or something on the hob.  Like I said we were with friends and overall despite the negatives we all made the best of everything and had a great time but we are experienced centre parc users and this one has a way to go yet to get up to speed and some serious rethinking is required.    if your thinking of a European alternative to the expensive UK then perhaps try Belgium.

We were pretty happy with the price of the cottage - about \\u00a3480 for a week for a 3 bedroom comfort villa POSITIVES1) As it only opened in June the cottage was spotless and extremely well appointed. Top marks for the very well-equipped kitchen. Unlike other european CPs a toaster is included and they also have a dishwasher. No oven although there is a 4 ring hob and a combi-microwave. It would be helpful if the instructions for the microwave were provided as we could not work out how to use it for anything other than reheating. Filter coffee maker - although don\\'t forget to take filters as none are provided. I was bowled over by the amazing selection of brooms, crockery and glassware. Unless you want something particularly niche you don\\'t need to take any cooking equipment - except maybe your own knives. There were plenty of plug sockets, including one outside. Beds were comfy with plenty of bedlinen and pillows available. I was surprised that the master bedroom had no hanging space, just shelves. There is a safe. 2) The mulitfunctional electronic wristbands  provided were very convenient, particularly in the swimming pool as I hate swimming with those cumbersome wrist keybands you usually get. You can preload these with money as well to save taking your wallet to the Dome as you can use them in the shop and restaurants. 3) On-site Caffefour had pretty much everything you wanted although more expensive than visiting the SuperU at Loudun, a 15 minute drive and easy to find. Indeed a trip to Loudun is a must, it\\'s a beautiful town. There is a boulangerie in Les Trois Moutier which I went to each morning for baguette and croissants, a pretty 10 minute drive and MUCH cheaper and tastier than onsite. There is a regional food shop in the Dome which is very competitively priced for regional wines4) Very easy to leave the park for the day, unlike CP here in the UK. 5) Aquamondo is amazing, loads of different pools and very well set out. Lots of seating and the outdoor pool is fantastic. Several large flumes including some &quot;black holes&quot; only suitable for adults. My husband had a blast. Daughter managed to fall on some steps while running in excitement and cut her leg, the first aid was excellent. The cenote pool is tucked away by the flumes and was very quiet so if you have tinies or just like peace and quiet you can easily paddle about in there on your own. The fun area for children was top notch, my daughter absolutely loved it. Everything about Aquamondo was fantastic, could not fault it. 6) There are lots of play areas dotted around the site, really imaginative and well thought out. The soft play and free entertainment in the fun factory kept my daughter entertained for about 2 hours while Mummy and Daddy enjoyed a very reasonably priced carafe of Rose d\\'Anjou. Next to the fun factory is a petting zoo with chickens, rabbits, small pigs and goats. There is also a small farm although we did not get a chance to go in there. 7) Loads of wildlife everywhere including deer by the dozen which came right up to our front door. We had a visit from an extremely friendly cat; the centre lake has been thoughtfully planted with interesting bog/marsh plants and was full of frogs, dragonflies, moorhens, ducks 8) We were happy with the meal that we ate in Cocoon. Others have complained about the pricing but we did not find it very expensive compared to UK CPs. Maybe living in the South East we are just used to paying more. 9) Brilliant idea to have &quot;hamlets&quot; of cottages with individual car parks. Much, much, much better and meant we were just 5 minutes amble from our carCOULD BE IMPROVED1) There is no information provided in the cottages about the takeaway service which seems to me to be rather odd. Also all the information on the centre timetable provided was in French. As I speak French this was not a problem for us but as they have a lot of English/Dutch/German guests I was very surprised that they did not offer foreign language versions. Similarly there were no instructions on how to work the microwave or the safe - an information folder in the villas would be very helpful with menus for the restaurants, opening times etc. A section each in French, English, Dutch. The information on site was very scant and the reception was not particularly well manned2) Activities were prohibitively expensive. I would have like to have done archery but at about 17E for half an hour this was out of the question. The only activity which wasn\\'t too expensive was the pedalos at 10e for half an hour 3) Restaurants all stop serving food at 2pm which seems bizarre in a park where you have a captive audience. Also very late opening in the evening at 7pm. Normally this would be OK for our daughter but after a full day bike riding, swimming and running around she was too tired to wait until 7pm. I appreciate that this may be a cultural thing but when a lot of your customers have young children it seems odd not to offer an earlier mealtime. 4) 10am opening of Aquamondo is ridiculously late. We went out for the day on 3 days and it would have been nice to get an early swim before heading out for the day. 5) No wifi in the villas is highly annoying although it was good to have a screen-free week as a family so maybe there is something in it ;DBut these &quot;negatives&quot; had very little impact on our stay, more just points that could be improved. They certainly didn\\'t spoil our holiday and we have been recommending the new Park to all our friends.

I wished they had horses for adults, and lessons(dressage, or jumping, or countryrides) for more experienced riders.We as a family would have loved hacking out, or a dressage lesson every day. The pizzeria bad service (we arrived, had to wait for a table, and were forgotten, and three families who arrived after we did, got a table sooner than we) and then the food turned out to be not really special. Also the openingtimes of restaurants are not suited too our ideas, our kids get very hungry at 5 or 6 o\\'clock, 7 is too late. So we didn\\'t eat at the restaurants any more after one time. And where can we just sit outside, and just have a drink, nowhere, so that was a downer too.AquaMundo and adventure course are fantastic. The kids loved it, had a great time. Paintball and Archery, great instructors. But don\\'t advertise swimming with fish. That is a no-no.The park is very difficult to find, we got lost. We had rented a e-car, and bikes, you need them, the park is big, especially with someone in your party who can\\'t walk very well.The nature path was great, my youngest son enjoyed himself very much.Get more activities like lasergame, mystery mission, and put folders up in the reception of activities in the neighbourhood.

At the time of booking our holiday we chose a Comfort Cottage, which turned out to be a pleasant home for a week. On arrival into the park the queue of cars was daunting, especially as it was quite hot, however, the queue quickly moved and we were handed our cottage keys (a rubber plastic watch that allows for keyless entry), we had pre checked in online and had an entry pass - we would highly recommend this otherwise your check in could be lengthy. Sadly on arrival at our cottage the keyless entry watches didnt work. After spending quite some time trying to call someone at reception, we finally had an engineer turn up 15 mins later to tell us we would have to walk to the reception desk at the dome to get new keys. Not a great start, and the engineer was far from friendly. having walked from our cottage to the dome, we soon realised hiring bikes was essential - we have 5 (4 at the time) year old who does not do distance walking! Hiring bikes was easy and well worth the money. 2 bikes, one with a burly carriage cost less than 100 Euros. The swimming complex in the dome is amazing, and has something for every age. The restaurants were surprisingly good, our favourite was the pizza restaurant. Our son loved all of the outdoor climbing frames and slides. He loved the boat ride on the lake, the pony ride and mini golf. But most of all, he was amazed by the deer who came to visit our cottage each day. On his 5th birthday, which we celebrated while we were there, we had at least 10 in the front and back of our cottage. The whole layout of the parc is brilliant, pathways are lovely, landscaping is beautiful, frogs in the lake, the treehouses look out of this world...thats our next visit planned! All in all we loved our visit, the only reason i havent given it 5 stars is because the staff need to be a little friendlier and the service to book for activities wasnt great.

{"reviewer_id": "098915D07B81D50070A55D7F5E3BAFC7", "review_language": "en", "review_id": "309483609", "pid": "38673", "locid": "7107948", "review": "Any brand-spanking new venue is bound to be good on at least at some level, and Le Bois Aux Daims is no exception.The accommodation is of a very high standard, very modern, but otherwise not dissimilar to other villages. We were in a standard &quot;Comfort&quot; cottage, but it is hard to see what more you would want. The premium cottages have their beds made for them, and you get a DVD player and an extra TV, but otherwise they are identical. To get more space you need to go VIP.The kitchens are fully equipped as they claim, but with the one exception - like all European Centerparcs - they don\\'t have an oven. So cooking is by microwave or on the hob. One solution to this, if you like to cook, is to bring an electric barbecue. We did see some cottages with charcoal ones, but they aren\\'t allowed. In any case, anyone lighting a fire in the middle of the woods in the middle of a heatwave must be crazy - and should be ejected from the park without ceremony in my opinion.Of especial mention is that whilst there are dishwashers, they are not charged with salt or rinse-aid. No problem, you would think; go buy some from the shop. Only they don\\'t sell either! If you want clean glasses (especially) either bring your own supplies or wash up by hand. There are some treehouses which looked absolutely brilliant from the outside, so I would guess that if you can afford one they would be great fun.Les Bois Aux Daims is the second Centerparcs to feature a &quot;ring road&quot; for cars, with parking in blocks adjacent to the cottages. This is a fantastic solution to the perennial problem of loading/unloading you car, and allows you to come and go off-site without having to drive through the park proper. Consequently, even on arrival days you never see cars other than round the access road to each block of cottages.Once inside, the park is quite compact compared to Les Trois Forets (the next newest site), but because it has fewer cottages it never really feels too busy. The site is flat, so if you are walking it is not too far to go and there are no hills to climb. However, the paths that link the cottage blocks to the dome area are all absolutely straight lines, so you don\\'t get any sense of walking in a forest. In fact, unlike Les Trois Forets or England\\'s Sherwood Forest, there is little opportunity to explore woodland. However, there is a special nature area that you can walk in. Aside from that much of the forest has been fenced off.The reason for this and what is brilliant (and is why you can\\'t wander amongst the trees) is the sheer scale of wildlife everywhere. This is no barren caravan site like Woburn Abbey - it teems with life. Especially charming are the deer that wander around the place and seem to tour all the cottages on the way. They are quite happy to come quite close to  your window and munch all the nice new shrubs that have been planted! Keep cameras to hand...Again, unlike Woburn, there has been a serious effort to preserve the original forest, and many more trees and shrubs have been planted as well.We came equipped to deal with bugs as, since the cottages don\\'t have aircon, they can be a problem with the windows open. We were very pleasantly surprised that even in the middle of summer bugs were not a problem. Perhaps this will change as the site matures (and things start to breed), but at least for now fly swats are not required.Every Centerparcs has bikes to hire, but here there are no electric bikes available. This is no big deal, as the site is almost completely flat. You can hire 4-seat and 6-seat electric golf-buggies though, and these probably provide the best option for those with mobility issues. You need a driving licence (which they will photocopy) before you can rent one, and no-one without a licence is permitted to drive. In practice they will stop children driving if they catch you but that\\'s it. There are also dedicated disabled parking spaces outside some of the cottages. Worth knowing is that the entire site is electric. All the staff vehicles are electric - and sensibly driven - so you don\\'t feel like you are living/walking on a main road.The dome itself is brilliant. You get given wrist bands as you arrive (like at Woburn), which you use to open and close lockers. This is much more comfortable than wearing keys, but has the disadvantage that you have to remember your locker number. However, the staff have gadgets that can read your band if you forget. The bands can also be charged up with money, so that you can make purchases without the need to carry cards or cash about.The pool area is everything a Centerparcs should be (and everything Woburn is not).  The main pool is large (although not as large as Les Trois Forets - but then there aren\\'t as many people trying to get in), and slopes very gently to start with - so it is absolutely safe for the smallest of toddlers. The wave machine is graduated according to the time of day (at least as far as we could tell). In the afternoon, when there are little ones about, the waves are fairly gentle. As the day goes on the waves get more violent to the point where they are genuinely exciting (like the original Centerparcs of yore). It\\'s worth pointing out that, unlike England - where taking a photo of even your own children makes you a paedophile - cameras are welcome. You can also buy the professionally taken ones at a counter on the way out which are to a high standard.The outside area has the standard rapids, which can get very busy of course, but absolutely everyone come off grinning their socks off (not to mention a bit battered). It\\'s worth noting that despite signs forbidding arm bands or toddlers, parents are happy to take them round, and the staff are happy to allow them. This is in total contrast to England where anything remotely exciting is banned on safety grounds. Of course, it does mean you have to take care not to bump into small children, but then why wouldn\\'t you?The outdoor swimming pool has the same features as Les Trois Forets, but on a smaller scale. So there is a powerful waterfall to stand under, strong water jets to try and swim against (you can\\'t) and lots of bubble machines. The &quot;rapid river&quot; is strong enough to whiz you round, but the jets are not as powerful as Les Trois Forets.The children\\'s slide is great fun for all ages and lands in it\\'s own area linked to the outdoor pool. Speaking of children\\'s areas, there is a dedicated section of the dome, with a sand area and a great climbing-frame with water pistols and tipping buckets and so on. Unlike Les Trois Forets the pistols are not quite strong enough to soak waiting parents around the edge, but I suppose you can\\'t complain about that!Up a lot of steps are the adult slides (height restrictions apply). All the rubber rings say &quot;We create emotions&quot; (from the manufacturer). And it couldn\\'t be more true. The most exciting rides wouldn\\'t go amiss at Alton Towers, and make anything we\\'ve seen in the other parks pale by comparison. The most heart stopping has a near vertical drop as you step on and is so quick you barely have time to breath. It\\'s a fast enough ride to warrant it\\'s own timer which shows you how long you took (about 30 seconds) - always fun in a family group.The other big ride is a rubber ring slide that drops you down and then up again like in a skateboard park. You swing round at the top (you have no control over this) then drop back down into another exit tube. Which way you end up in the tube is a bit hit and miss, but try to end up feet first if you can.Not so high up are the tamer rides, suitable for the more faint-hearted. The height restriction is much less too. Finally, at the lowest level is a long, gentle rubber-ring ride and a long body ride which ends up in the outdoor pool. These are quite safe even for smaller children.The French have a very relaxed attitude to rules, but the height restriction on the top rides, along with the traffic light system are strictly enforced.Because the rides are short, queueing isn\\'t really a problem - certainly better than going to Alton Towers or other theme parks.There are a couple of hot pools as well, although you will have to look for them (a good thing). You will also find a climbing wall, which challenges all but the strongest. Nearly everyone ends up falling off (into its own dedicated pool).The park makes much of the Cenote pool, but it is oversold. Basically it is a small, shallow pool which, if you put your head underwater (masks supplied) you can look at fish tanks. Unfortunately there is nothing in them worth holding your breath for.Other Centerparcs have a good range of non-pool activities, but this one has some limitations.The boat rides are fun, and there is an option of both a child-sized and adult-sized electric boat which you take up the lake and round the &quot;river&quot;. All the way there and back will last the time the boat has been hired for. There are standard pedalos for those feeling energetic enough. Lifejackets are provided.You can try the Segways  - more safety wear is supplied than we\\'ve seen before (a good thing but it takes longer to get dressed at the start). You can try archery, but there are no crossbows or air rifles. The biggest thing missing is the Sports Pavilion. So no indoor courts or eating area. There are outdoor tennis courts and (laughably) outdoor badminton courts though. Also a beachball area although we never saw anyone using it.The farm area for kids seems fine, but we don\\'t have small children to really know.The restaurants are standard Centerparcs fair - expensive and not very good. But the staff are all friendly, will try English to the best of their ability, and service is reasonably quick (quicker than other sites). Worth a special mention in its own right is the wifi. You get around 35Mbps and the voucher covers up to 4 devices for the week (or shorter if you prefer). That is faster than most people have at home, so streaming four simultaneous HD movies at once is absolutely no problem. BT could learn a few lessons from here. The four devices are not restricted to the first four you connect. You can keep adding devices - all that happens is the oldest one used is then thrown off. So you might have 3 iPads and four phones, for example, and all can connect, but only 4 at a time. If you use a VPN service you can watch BBC TV or other streamed UK channels. Netflix works in France as well - all you need to do is select the (original) English soundtrack.All in all you probably get the impression we had a really great time - we did.I only marked down a star because of the lack of a Sports Centre. Personally it didn\\'t bother us, but if you like to do a lot of low-cost court activity, the park is sorely lacking.I thoroughly recommend Les Bois Aux Dames - for our needs it is the best Centerparcs yet.

It is a lovely park, car-free, lovely forest, really calm, peaceful atmosphere. We saw lots of deer, which was nice.The facilities for young kids are fantastic, the aquamondo, action factory and playgrounds get 5 stars. The only downside for us in terms of the kids was that the restaurants don\\'t open for dinner til 7, too late for small kids, or for ours anyway. The aquamondo also doesn\\'t open til 10, by which time my kids have been up for 3 to 4 hours, we would have liked to be able to go in there earlier.The accomodation was lovely, clean, nicely decorated, there was a nice deck with outdoor furniture. I would have liked an oven, but hey, we managed with the grill/microwave thing. The bed was really comfortable and the shower and bath were great.You can get bread and croissants delivered to your door in the morning, which is nice, though they\\'re not as nice as the ones available in the bakery in the dome.The things we were disappointed by were: 1 the restaurants were expensive with very mediocre and not particularly healthy food. The Jungle Circus Buffet is the best value for money and the kids loved the decor and the giant heron.2 the price of the activities is extortionate. (11 euro for &quot;baby swimming lesson&quot; which was 20 babies and more than 30 adults squashed into a small pool in the aquamondo with a bunch of water toys, 17 euro for half an hour archery and you have to share a bow and arrows with whoever you went with- better value if you go alone.)3 there wasn\\'t enough info on the website about activities, prices etc and we weren\\'t able to book acitivites or reserve bikes online beforehand, despite getting numerous emails encouraging us to do so. Also, the treetops adventure course (parcours ouisti) was advertised on the English language website as being suitable for 3 to 6 year olds. When we arrived and tried to book this acitivity, we were informed our son wasn\\'t tall enough, there is a height restriction of 1m10. There was no mention of this on the website, in either language, and he was very disappointed as he loves climbing. All in all, we were happy with our holiday and I feel that we got good value for money. This was because we travelled outside of French school holidays, got a discount for booking 6 months in advance and got a further family discount because we had children under 5.

As the Parc is very new the accommodation is stylish and spacious. The kitchen and bathrooms were very clean (although floors were slightly dusty in places). No air conditioning which proved hot at night. Outside was less aesthetic, all 991 cottages look identical and are laid out in rows along tarmac roads. Shrubbery yet to grow up so rather bare looking.  Long straight tracks led us to the central area. Our children loved the 10 -15 minute scooter ride to the restaurants (nicest area is along the river by the tree houses where birds and frogs can be heard).Check-in was pretty quick and whilst there were queues to book activities these were not too long if you picked the right time; an online booking system would be a good idea. If you can speak some French it does help too!Buffet restaurant was excellent with a play area for younger children (our children would not eat anywhere else!) Lots of choice and good service. Can recommend both breakfast and supper. Swimming pool area is huge and well thought out with lots of fun shoots, slides and wave machines.  Very busy and crowded and our daughter (9) bumped her head (all was ok) coming down a slide. As an adult I would have loved an area to swim a few lengths but I guess that\\'s not what Center Parcs is all about! Changing rooms could have been cleaner and general public toilets were less than desirable in the complex. No clothes washing facilities at all so had to go to Saumur for a launderette.

We had a meat fondue one evening &amp; there was loads of steak. The buffet restaurant was lovely. Lots of choice &amp; the meat was cooked beautifully. Italian restaurant also nice &amp; the staff were all very helpful and we all muddled by nicely with a bit of French/English which was all good fun.Not such a good experience at Cocoon. No problem with the food and our waitress was delightful however she just could not cope with her workload. She could not have tried harder but she just didn\\'t have enough support. We ended up leaving after waiting almost an hour for dessert menus. We had made in advance for our meal &amp; this was on our last night so it was quite disappointing. We did end up getting our drinks FOC so we weren\\'t out of pocket.We saw lots of wildlife, the animal observatory is fabulous. The children were so excited to see the deer in the garden &amp; I loved all the beautiful dragonflies.Action factory is a great space for the children &amp; so much attention to detail in the decor. My 10 year old loved the Aqua Speed activity. As it was a large group they split them in 2 and they got to do a few other things as well. A bit of a VIP Aquamundo experience! Archery also good. The instructor was very good at correcting the children &amp; helping them to improve.The electric boat was also an enjoyable experience. Nice to have the river to go down rather than just going around the lake. For anyone used to CP UK, you don\\'t get iron, towels or BBQ in premium.All in all it\\'s a lovely park with mainly very helpful &amp; friendly staff and we would certainly consider another trip ", "title": "Beautiful park, could be perfect.", "rating": "4", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/a8/31/8b/center-parcs-domaine.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Bois aux Daims", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Route des Trois Moutiers", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Nouvelle-Aquitaine", "postalCode": "86120", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "August 24, 2015", "trip_type": "Traveled with family", "trip_date": " August 2015"},

It has only been open a few weeks but the teething troubles were minor. It\\'s also got a different feel and approach to the UK CPs so you have to be careful not to make assumptions.It was overwhelmingly a good holiday with a few drawbacks that prevented it being great. First the positives:(1) It\\'s a new parc so everything feels fresh and in good repair. The accommodation (we stayed in a VIP cottage for six) was spacious and well-equipped, with comfortable beds.(2) The car park set-up is great - not sure why nobody thought of it in the UK. Each hamlet of cottages has its only dedicated parking, meaning you don\\'t have to trek to get to/from your cars.(3) The cottages have got a great supply of crockery/glassware - it sounds silly but in the UK there\\'s often only enough for each person, which is a pain.(4) The Aqua Mundo is great, with a range of things to do in there. The slides are particularly good and the queues were never more than a few minutes.(5) The Action Factory (indoor play for children up to about 8-10) is a great idea, and offers free activity (for children) and a nice place to have a coffee/read a book (for the adults). There are a number of outdoor play areas dotted around the park, which is good.(6) The onsite Carrefour is well stocked, if a little thin on fresh meat/fish (it\\'s either frozen or you have to buy it from the deli counter ready prepared). As you\\'d expect, there\\'s a good boulangerie within the store for croissants, bread, etc.(7) The bikes have built in locks (I\\'ve not seen this before but apparently it\\'s common in Europe), so it\\'s less faffy than taking locks around with you.(8) It was great having deer wander past your patio.(9) The CPs team were all very positive and helpful and there was a good level of spoken English (to deal with broken freezer doors, etc.).And a few things that irked:(1) Queues! Oh my goodness! If you want to book an activity or raise a query, reckon on queuing for 30-40 minutes as standard. I can\\'t imagine how we\\'d deal with it in England - our first world problems radar would go into overload!!!! Why are there no consoles or online booking facilities, like in England?(2) I tried to get the European CPs app before going but it\\'s only available if you have a European iTunes account. Can it not just be available through the UK store as well? There\\'ll be loads of customers wanting it.(3) I popped out to LeClerc in Loudun for a few things one morning and then had to queue for 40 minutes to get back onto the site, because I got mixed in with the day visitors\\' queue. It\\'s a single track road and was chaos with people driving the wrong way down the road and queue jumping, with a total absence of management from the CPs\\' staff.(4) It\\'s a French/European thing but you can forget getting an evening meal before 7pm. Maybe the English just need to suck it up but one of the great things about CPs in the UK is that you can be flexible with meal times, as well as eating at 5pm if you have smaller children.(5) Very little is available (activities) on changeover days - we were there for a week and a half, so had two changeovers. For example, the boats were not available after lunchtime on Thursday until Saturday, effectively closed for a day and a half, which seemed strange.Viz (4) and (5) there were points when it felt a little bit like the site was not really set-up for our convenience as customers, so much as their convenience (staff/management). That\\'s a little harsh but it did have that feel sometimes.(6) Having to pay for WiFi in the \\'luxury\\' accommodation was annoying (so we didn\\'t bother).Don\\'t let the negatives put you off though - it\\'s a lovely site with a good mix of activities and facilities. I\\'m not sure how good it would be outside the summer months - there\\'s not a huge amount to do indoors (certainly compared with the UK and the huge Jardin des Sports facilities) and the range on offer is thinner than the UK. Finally, we asked the children whether they\\'d prefer UK or French CPs for the future and they instinctively went for the UK. They\\'re seasoned travellers so I think this viewpoint was shaped by the activities rather than the location.", "title": "Nice park but sort out the queues!", "rating": "4", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/a8/31/8b/center-parcs-domaine.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Bois aux Daims", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Route des Trois Moutiers", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Nouvelle-Aquitaine", "postalCode": "86120", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "August 24, 2015", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " August 2015"},

When we first approached the park (at 3.30pm on a Monday) we were abit alarmed by the queue of cars waiting to check in.... However checkin was extremely efficient and I think we were 25 minutes from first getting to be park to walking in our front door!The resort Is sparkly and new and although we only booked a comfort lodge, the furnishings and presentation  were excellent. The play areas  dotted around the park are lovely, as is the nature trail, with a great treetop rope walk....Aqua Mundo was fantastic (if you aren\\'t so fussed about lunch timings go there between 1 &amp; 2.30 when everybody is eating)My daughter loved the soft play, which is big and lots of fun, there is a cafe/pancake place there too!As we had booked via booking.com (and got an amazing deal) we were unable to pre-book bikes/ activities online. Being centre parcs novices it was lucky that we popped down to check out the bike store the afternoon we arrived - we decided to hire some there and then - by the time we cycled by that evening there were none left - so pre-book or get down there quickly!! We hired a Poussyclette for our daughter rather than a bike, she scooted around the paths but when she got tired we popped the scooter and her in the Poussyclette!We really did enjoy our week and can\\'t wait to return, it is obviously a French resort but between our rather limited school French and the great efforts of the staff we had no communication problems at all and found all the staff to be very helpful and polite. On a few of the nights we were there it was extremely hot and humid, there is no air conditioning in the cottages or the public areas (prob only a problem in July &amp; August) but if you have room In Your car I\\'d pack a fan for your bedroom at night!!As others have said, the information/booking desk is understaffed and doesn\\'t open until 10, a few more people manning the desk would be a  huge improvement.Finally - as we were there for a week, it would\\'ve been great if there had been an onsite launderette. We did manage a hand wash and there are drying racks in the cottage but it would be very beneficial for those staying longer than a weekend.Aside from the areas of improvement  suggested, we really had a fantastic time and would highly recommend this as a lovely holiday for those with young ones.

It is obvious that the site is new and there are a few things to improve - we had a couple of leaks in our cabin but didn\\'t mention this until we left as we didn\\'t want to have to move location. There was also the appearance that not enough staff had yet been recruited and as another review states it was not that easy to get information. Although our French is poor we managed to get by with the usual few words and pointing (and of course don\\'t expect English to be spoken although we are like most other lazy Brits). The deer were a highpoint and wandered through our garden area each day.The cabin we stayed in was an end of row (a good thing) and the garden area was large enough for our boys to play football in. We liked the parking as there was no long trek to get the car with each zone/hamlet having a small parking area. I do wonder how long the cabins will look smart but that\\'s one for CP to worry about I guess.The pool is also the best we have been in and whilst busy was less crowded (perhaps because it is larger) than other parks. The slides were far and away the best we have seen and two of them are for thrill seekersOne thing that bugs us about Centreparcs in recent years is the growth of the electric buggies that are used by lazy but able people. Whilst they may not emit fumes they are basically small cars and spoil the car free ideal - clearly another way to earn cash but why not just stick 50 euros on the weekly charge and get rid of them unless the customer has a real need?It would be great to see bike racks/storage outside of the cabins - with five bikes it is a pain trying to find somewhere secure to lock them.In short a great Centreparcs and we\\'d return if we holiday in this area of France in future.Not related to this park and more a general comment on Centreparcs and their poor on-going customer relationships - although we have now been on around 12 Centreparcs holidays of various lengths, we have little communication from them and no reward for loyalty. I guess you could say my opening statement means this is redundant but having worked for Walt Disney World for 5 years, I know that despite a loyal customer base it\\'s still cheaper to get more business from loyal customers than from new customers - we\\'ve never had a discount or upgrade or even a thank you.PositivesNew SpaciousGreat cabins - we were in an EdenTags to get into the cabin and pool lockers - Vs keys and tokens or euros elsewhereEasy to locate cabinParking close to all customersBrilliant pool and slidesGarden big enough for footballLots of park areas for small kidsEnough food to keep most families happy and with the current exchange rate pretty cheap.

We arrived at 3.30pm, and checked in at gate quickly and efficiently. We should have been able to get straight into our chalet at that time, however the cleaners were still in there and asked us to come back in a bit.  It all went a bit downhill from there! We decided to go get our pre booked bikes and book activities at the main reception! An hour later of standing in a queue at reception in 30 degrees heat, (no air con in centre!) and I was loosing patience, not to mention the will to live! When eventually got to the front it to was to a fairly unhelpful young man, as some of the things I had prebooked and paid for prior to coming had not gone onto booking. He basically said he couldn\\'t help me with it. I had asked for a 2 person spa and for the comfort service in our chalet ( ie beds made on arrival, towels etc) and there was no mention of these on the paperwork when we arrived.  We gave up on the bikes for the moment, as hot and stressed, and went back to room. Cleaners still there, changing cushions as previous tenants left them in a mess apparently.  We didn\\'t have the comfort service that I had paid for, so had do do beds etc myself. And as I thought we had towels provided we hadn\\'t brought any. The cleaning lady got us some and she was very nice. When we went back to pick up bikes there was not much left even though we had pre booked and paid for them, and the queue to get out with them was massive. My husband and boys waiting over an hour to get out with the bikes!, please CP you need more staff on on changeover days, at reception, bikes and anywhere customers have to queue for stuff!!!!  The next morning I met a manager called Sylvie at the welcome cocktail morning, and she was very good, refunded all the money for the things we hadn\\'t got, so my husband and I went and booked our spa session then.  The chalet was lovely, clean, bright, well equipped and spacious. Pool fab, great Rapids and flames.  We enjoyed our week, the activities were great. High ropes full course, ( blue &amp; red routes) is a brilliant , long, and worth the money activity.  Pony riding for kids a bit naff, basically up the road and back again!  The spa does treatments for children, we had a mother and daughter massage, and that was my 10 yr olds first spa experience. Shame they wouldn\\'t let her use any of the spa facilities afterwards, not even the pool, and basically we were herded straight out after massage. And after using the spa facilities at Elvedon, I found it a bit disappointing, as not many different rooms/ areas.

This was our first family trip together to a Centre Parcs, although our two older kids have been to a UK site with other family members. I wanted to put a few minds at rest as I find trip advisor can be a bit negative at times. In short we will go back again and do the bits we did not get to do as ran out of time.TRAVEL - Once you get down toward Les Trois Moutiers, there are very clear signs for Centre Parcs off the D 347. (Make sure you approach via this road between Montreuil-Bellay and Loudun) (We ended up in the back yards of Saumur Vineyards due to SatNav failure - Not Centre Parcs\\' fault)CHECK IN - We had pre - checked in over the net. Turned up at the main front gate and within minutes were allowed in, with verbal directions, clear signs and two electronic door access wrist bands per family. A short time later we easily found our accommodation being two seperate three bedroom cottages with four deer in the back garden area.Once unpacked, I drove my car around the short one way system, parked it up in the designated parking area and pretty much forgot about it, until departure day a week later.Everything is new, so yes its clean and sparkly and yes there are new trees and shrubs planted about to designate areas between accommodation, but give them a break. They built it in a forest area and it takes times to bed in so to speak. Have a look at the pictures and make your own minds up. Personally we had no issues with the views.Cycling from our area to the DOME (main centre for the pool and restaurants) took a couple of minutes. By foot it was all of five minutes.All the hire bikes are new (Mountain bikes or traditional curved handled old style (but new) bikes with options of child trailer or child seats. (We took our own bikes so can not comment on the hiring procedure). All hire bikes come with locks. Kids (and adults) loved the swimming pools and slides and the little one loved the small sand pit area part of the pool with its own slide and obviously warmer heated water. This little sandpit area could have been bigger though as a good number of under I would say fours were in it.I did seen one question on here asking about swimming shorts. I was in Quicksilver surf shorts the whole time. No one said a word and i would say 50 percent of those swimming had on one form of shorts or another. I did not feel out of place.Great options for food, (Buffet all you can eat, an Italian, another restaurant which was a cuban BBQ the night we went, option on food delivery to your cottage for BBQ, gallette restaurant and more).Kids (12, 10 and 10) and I loved the arial tree course (Blue one). Were a little sad that we did not get to do the red zip wire course too for the extra 6 euros. (will do it next time)Cycling around was easy, but you do need to keep your wits about you, as everyone thinks they have right of way.There are a number of fun areas for kids which appear on various corners as you move about.I would suggest pre booking some activities if thats what you want or getting them sorted the first day to save dissapointment.

We liked the wild flowers and the serenity of the setting, and you can find peaceful rides and walks here. It is an enormous area with cottages scattered far and wide, so bikes or buggy hire is a complete must, it will take you a very long time to walk everywhere otherwise. I would recommend you book bike hire or buggy hire at the time of booking to be sure you have this in place.The cottages:They are very nicely decorated, modern and well equipped and brand new. They were not, however sparkling clean, and I found it very disappointing to be cleaning the bathroom having only just checked in. This property will not survive years of constant use unless the housekeeping department is trained and the cottages are cleaned properly. The bed linens were spotless as were the bathroom towels. However the level of cleanliness was not high enough. I would take travel plugs etc with you, and also extra clothes, there is no laundry facilities at all, so it is isn\\'t easy to wash anything or dry clothes. Take your own pillows!!! We pre booked welcome packs and morning essentials, non of which arrived. No one speaks English on the reception desk so it was impossible to find out even a week later where they are...we pre paid for them, so we feel slightly annoyed that we have still not received a refund or an answer as to where they are....The pools are great fun, and the children had a brilliant time on the slides. The outside paving area of black slate is absolutely lethal and needs looking at immediately. We saw numerous people slipping on the slate when it becomes wet. The slides were fabulous and non stop fun for the day. The changing areas were clean and well organised. The action factory was good fun and the parks dotted around the parc were super to ride to and enjoyed by the children.The tree experience is not for the faint hearted but exhilarating for children looking for adventure. I would recommend you look at it before booking. The staff were kind and helpful at the activity centre. The boats were a lovely experience too.All of the animation is completely in French so the international children had no idea what was going on and could not join in. I would recommend the parc to at least include some international languages as they do in other countries so that all children can join in....The language skills of all the staff generally is very limited or non existent, we speak french so we could make ourselves understood most of the time although no one could understand about the welcome packages etc, but it was surprising that they did not seem to know one word of English or any other language given how many different nationalities were staying there.The restaurants were acceptable, we liked the italian style restaurant and the outside seating area of cocoon was gorgeous in the evening by the water. They kept running out of wine!! Which you do not expect in France!!! But all the staff were really nice and friendly. We would love to see a proper french restaurant there rather than burgers and chips. Some fine dining would be a wonderful addition and a reflection of the country the parc was placed in.Finding out information when you are there was quite tricky so try and do your research before you go. The queues for the reception were endless. Everywhere was quite under staffed, so expect to queue for everything.The supermarket was a marvel and brilliantly stocked with everything. There is no need to take lots of food or cleaning products from home. Everything is there and reasonably priced. The warm daily baguettes available every morning were the highlight of our mornings!!All in all we had a really great time, it was a fun and active holiday, the children will love every moment that is for sure!! We probably would return on reflection.", "title": "Boring?? Absolutely not!

There is still a lot of construction taking place with no segregation to stop visitor from getting into areas still to be completed.  It is difficult to have a traffic free environment when there are builder\\'s vans and trucks driving about from 6.30 in the morning.  When on my bike the first morning I had to pull off one of the paths due to a lorry coming down the other way with nowhere for me to go but into the grass at the side.  A lot of the features are still being built and staff are not prepared to apologise for any disruption caused. There doesn\\'t seem to be any thing to highlight what features are ready and you only find out by turning up at them to see they are still being built.  If we had known that the park was still to be completed at the time we booked we would have gone else where.  The buffet restaurant is overpriced with very little choice.  Other restaurants don\\'t seem to have much choice either.  Pool complex is good but again some area are still to be finished.

The site as a whole is nicely done, set in pine forest that\\'s been partially cleared, and centred around a large lake that is partly nature reserve and partly navigable.To get something out of the way straight-off, two images Center Parcs use to market the site are a deer in the woods, and pictures of kids snorkelling alongside aquariums teeming with coral and marine fish.The \\'cenote pool\\' is a let down. For whatever reason, they didn\\'t install marine aquariums but a freshwater Amazon themed tank. In my opinion the result is very dull and disappointing, so if that image is what attracted you to the site forget about it. For us it didn\\'t really make a difference but they should definitely change their advertising image as right now it is totally deceptive.On the other hand there are deer (Fallow deer) in some of the areas of the parc. I get the impression that they haven\\'t put them in areas where there are still some works going on but I could be wrong. We didn\\'t see any while in zone G but saw deer at the bottom of our garden (just a few feet away) almost every day when things were quiet in zone A which was magical for he kids.The cottages are all semi-detached. They look small and crowded together from the outside but inside there\\'s actually plenty of room and once inside you don\\'t really notice the other cottages. Sound insulation between the cottages seems to be perfect. The little terrace/deck at the back is fairly private and usually faces some forest. End-of-row cottages are probably the best.We stayed in both a VIP cottage and a basic Comfort cottage. The VIP cottage was very nicely designed (just like in the photos) with a large living area and good quality fittings. The Comfort cottage was a little smaller and more basic but not bad quality. Storage space in both was a little limited. The main bedroom in the Comfort cottage had a tiny little wooden cupboard with zero hangers. Still, this is not really a big deal.The cleaning done before you arrive seems pretty perfunctory. In both cottages there was a mountain of dust under all the beds. Not a big deal, but over time the cottages may get pretty grubby. Both cottages had a microwave, hotplate, kettle, toaster, fridge and dishwasher. There\\'s no air conditioning or fans, or sunshades for the big windows.The TV includes BBC1 and BBC2. It\\'s not possible to change the language on the French channels which is a shame because most broadcast US TV series and films with English as an option.The VIP cottage had a little blue-tooth hifi under the TV which could be linked to a smart phone. There\\'s no DVD or Blu-Ray player but if you bring a portable PC and a HDMI cable you can plug it into the TV.Mobile phone reception is patchy (1 to 3 bars). 3G connects very occasionally. They say a mast will be installed nearby in the Autumn.There\\'s a paying WiFi service but one thing they don\\'t mention is that you can connect to free WiFi (with your email address) in the main dome and around the Action Factory/ Creperie. This WiFi was actually lightning fast when we were there.In terms of on-site food we liked the Pizza restaurant. The choice is fairly small but the food is pretty good. The Cocoon restaurant next door had a slightly odd menu with barbeque options in the evening - if you like barbecued meat this could be a good choice but otherwise it\\'s pretty limited. The Jungle Circus restaurant is a buffet set-up, a bit like Flunch. Fairly basic but okay. We didn\\'t use the Quick fast food place but presumably it\\'s the same as their other outlets.There\\'s also a Creperie outside the dome. It\\'s a lovely location in the late evening with outdoor tables near the children\\'s play area but unfortunately it closes at 9pm. Would be great if it stayed open until at least 10pm in summer, and if they had a few more tables outside.The on-site Carrefour minimarket has a pretty good selection of food and household supplies although the prices are probably a little high. They had almost everything we needed.We didn\\'t hire bikes but we did take a golf cart for some days. You should reserve this in advance if you want it as they are very popular.We didn\\'t do that many on-site activities but we did hire an electric boat which we took around the lake and up the little river.The outdoor play area and Action Factory are great for small children. Plenty of swings and a small zip wire outside, and two different indoor play areas with foam-ball firing air cannons that seemed to delight the kids. There are also two good trampolines but these need tokens (jetons which cost 1.50 Euros each) which for now you can only buy in the arcade room next to the bowling alley in the main dome. One token gets you 6 minutes jumping, which is about enough for most kids.Aqua Mundo has several different sections. The changing areas are well done with plenty of locker space (locked using your bracelet). There\\'s a central indoor pool with waves from time to time. This links to a nice outdoor pool via a little river with a circular current that the kids love to go round and round. The outdoor pool has a little slide that\\'s fun for younger kids and young-at-heart adults.Back inside there\\'s also a children\\'s area with a couple of small slides, and water spraying everywhere. Nice for younger children.At one end of the dome there\\'s four slides, two for 1.2m minimum and two for 1.4m minimum. One of each is for buoys, the others without. These slides could get pretty busy at times but if you picked your moment the wait was usually okay.Finally, there\\'s the Crazy River which is a very popular feature that goes outdoors then back inside. As other reviewers have mentioned you can definitely get banged-up on this ride. It features light units which are not flush with the sides - given that the river is not even open at night this seems daft - but you soon learn to avoid bumping into these.In theory you\\'re supposed to sit down in the river but if you do so you won\\'t go fast, or at all, in many parts. Lying down on your front seems to work best but you will need to protect yourself from bumps as you go down. Basically if you\\'re prepared to put up with a bit of bruising it\\'s great fun and most people go round it again and again, which is why it can get crowded. The river closes around 8:20 to 8:30.There are plenty of places to visit in the area but don\\'t rely on the on-site tourist info. The site is in the extreme north west corner of the Vienne region and all the tourist information provided is for this region. The whole Loire valley and everything to the north, east and west of the site doesn\\'t exist as far as the tourist information center is concerned.If you have children I\\'d highly recommend the Bioparc Zoo which is 30 minutes away, but try to avoid a really hot day. Futuroscope (which is in the Vienne region) is an hour away. There are lots of chateaux to visit in the area, with Azay-le-Rideau 45 minutes away for example. Chateau Rivau is a pretty little castle about 40 minutes away.A few negatives...Center Parcs have clearly tried to minimize staffing, with the result that if you need to arrange things at busy times you spend way too much time queuing. e.g. at the golf cart hire place the desk has just one person who has take all the details and then go out to collect the cart, drive it over and show you how to use it before he can deal with the next person in the queue. If they could just hire a second person to do the other part of the job, at least on the busy arrival days, things would go much smoother.The activity shop (Fun Shop) is annoyingly understaffed too, with just one desk to take all enquiries and to book activities. It\\'s also closed two days a week plus two afternoons, and closed for lunch for two hours (have they not heard of having people work in shifts?). Clearly this saves Center Parcs some staffing costs but how many more activities would be booked if people could actually get served?The site has only been open three weeks so there\\'s plenty of bare earth and small plants/trees that will grow in time. There was a digging machine working one morning when we were there but otherwise no major works in the areas we stayed. Many of the tree houses were unfinished however, with major works going on during the day in our first week but I assume this will all be finished in a week or two. This would only disturb people staying in the open tree houses for now.At the time of writing the on-site aviary was almost empty and the wildlife walk apparently devoid of wildlife but presumably this will change.Overall we really liked the site and had a great time there. I would expect it to be even better next season once the vegetation has had a chance to grow a bit and some little teething problems are sorted out.TIPS:The queues of cars trying to get in around 3pm on the arrival days can be long so it\\'s probably best to arrive earlier or later. If you arrive before 3pm you can collect your welcome pack with bracelets at the gate. That way you can park in the day parking (which has shade) and visit the site. The bracelet will open the door of your cottage from 3pm. If you want to hire or collect bikes/buggies you can do this from 1pm, thus avoiding the madness when 400+ families try to do the same after 3.Checkout is by 10am. Your electronic key will stop working at this time so if you\\'re not out of the cottage keep the door open.Free WIFI :There\\'s a paying WiFi service but one thing they don\\'t mention is that you can connect to free WiFi (with your email address) in the main dome and around the Action Factory/ Creperie. This WiFi was actually lightning fast when we were there.You can load credit on your electronic bracelet which you can then use in the on-site shops and restaurants. This works pretty well but do make sure you use it up before leaving as there\\'s no refund service.", "title": "Great site despite a few little negatives", "rating": "4", "image_url": "https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/a8/31/8b/center-parcs-domaine.jpg", "hotel_type": "LodgingBusiness", "hotel_name": "Center Parcs Le Bois aux Daims", "price_range": "$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)", "hotel_adress": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "streetAddress": "Route des Trois Moutiers", "addressLocality": "", "addressRegion": "Nouvelle-Aquitaine", "postalCode": "86120", "addressCountry": {"@type": "Country", "name": "France"}}, "published_date": "July 17, 2015", "trip_type": null, "trip_date": " July 2015"},

A separate toilet with small details like a child toilet seat are nice extras. The only negative comment to be made is that the kitchen counter and floor were not properly cleaned. 5 minutes of additional attention from the cleaning crew could have easily fixed this and our first impression would have been perfect.The park itself is huge and the distance from the cottage to The Dome main area is quite big. Going back and forth a few times per day is simple not feasible. There are options to rent E-cars and bikes but unfortunately all cars were rented out already. If we had known upfront we would have booked the E-car. We did have the option to rent some bikes.There are plenty of activities onsite for adults and kids. They all need to be booked upfront so no queues to be expected except for those at the reservation counter. Unfortunately most of them are closed on Fridays and Mondays (arrival and departure days) and for a few hours at lunchtime. This is not very clearly mentioned on the booking website and reduces your options significantly if you only stay for the weekend.The Dome has a few restaurants which offer decent food so no real need to go offsite for dinner or lunch.

We had breakfast delivered to our cottage each day which was a nice little extra.In our cottage we had very poor GSM coverage and no 3G. Also there is no Wifi or wired internet available.
