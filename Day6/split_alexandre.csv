200;We went in the first week of the opening mid July. We had a 8 people VIP cottage, it was superb, Sauna, Hamma, Jacuzzi. 4 Bedroom.The parc is very big, so I cannot nto reomment to get bikes or the electric cars (better reserve the car before had as the go quick)The bird area was not yet functionnal (shame) but the hight up the tree observation tour to see the deers is nice well made (and we saw a fee deers)Aqua mundo is very nice, 4 slides (2 alone and 2 with rubber ring) the riviere sauvage is great, the small one outside for the kids is nice and not scary. The tank to watch the fish was a big success.The kids area with the water jets, springs and slides was very liked by my 6 year old. Where the 3 year old love to play in the small kids section where was also sand and two small slides.The houses in the trees did not seem finished yet but a return visit could be waranted. The action factory area is very nice.We have a daughter with severe food allergy, the staff was very help full in finding out if the allergy labes were there and what was allowed for her.On the down side it would have been nice to be warned on the website that some activies need trainers otherwise you cannot do them (one does not pack every shoe he has for 4 days break)Aventure route in the trees was quite scary if you listen to my wife and 10 year old daughter.ah yes not sure if it\'s done on purpose or if it was opening week but hardly any network coverage for mobiles (anywhere in the parc);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
201;We stayed for a week in a comfort cottage. 2 and a half bathrooms, large living/dining area and well equiped kitchen. Beds were comfortable and linen prestine. All in all no complaints. Bikes essential to avoid fairly large distance between cottages and the main Dome. Restaurants of a good standard although we were a bit tired of chips by the end! All activities well organised and staff extremely polite and helpful. I hope they keep up the standard as other sites in France seem to be less well kept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
202;This park is beautiful! If you like all things wooden, the sound of the wind breezing through the pine trees, peace and quiet, this is the spot to be.We stayed (2 adults, 2 small children) in a premium cottage. It was beautiful, well decorated, well equipped and clean.The park is beautiful, you could literally walk around it all day. The Aqua dome is AMAZING. The slides are great for young and old and the riviere sauvage is great fun. The distance from houses to the market dome can be quite long, we like walking so we didn\'t mind.  The deer often walked by early in the morning, this was wonderful to see. And.... It always helps if you speak French...PROSbeautiful areaEverything is on siteGood distraction for kidsRestaurants were fine (we tried il giardino and the jungle, the decor is great and the food was fine.The wristwatch you get at checkin acts as a key to your house and locker. It\'s a bit like the flat Swatch watches.Check in is at park entrance, no need to go to reception. Very efficient.CONSprobably start up teething problems: poor information/ indication of daily activities and what\'s on, most center parcs have an overview posted in several locations.Activities are quite expensive, it would be good if they would offer more bundles.The wifi connection at \u20ac40 for a week was just ok, it often hung and wouldn\'t be working properly again for quite some time. I would return again, the nature and the comfort of the house did it for us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203;"Wonderful break. Stayed in 8 bed Premium Cottage (as at time of purchasing it was same price as 6 bed Comfort during a Vente Flashe). Felt really luxurious. Went to Aquamondo twice daily (open until 8pm) during Mon-Fri stay. Super slides for all ages. Came home with loads of bruises. Even had a trip to A&amp;E during stay, as 6 yr old fell off bike (they don\'t supply helmets). Bikes not necessary but useful as it\'s mostly a 10 min walk from cottage to Aquamundo. All cars are parked in car park, after you have unloaded your bags. This is a great idea as it makes the park super safe for cycling. Best bits- everything was so simple, it made an adventurous break easy- plenty of activity combated any excesses - Very refreshing- super park, really nicely layout.Other remarks- Carrefour onsite slightly expensive but very convenient with very fresh fruit/veg. no need to use restaurants.- Helmets should be offered to cyclists- Better directions need to be supplied, as we ended up in miltary testing zone with the gps co-ordinates they supply.- Since no AC supplied, could Center Parcs supply fans, at a small cost?- as the park has only recently opened it will take a year or so for grass / trees to grow.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
204;This was our first experience in a French centre parcs we have been to others before in England.We stayed for a week with friends of ours and four children of all ages, and firstly we must praise the beautiful pine forest location of the parc, it is genuinely peaceful, intact thankfully given the amount of building work. We liked the wild flowers and the serenity of the setting, and you can find peaceful rides and walks here. It is an enormous area with cottages scattered far and wide, so bikes or buggy hire is a complete must, it will take you a very long time to walk everywhere otherwise. I would recommend you book bike hire or buggy hire at the time of booking to be sure you have this in place.The cottages:They are very nicely decorated, modern and well equipped and brand new. They were not, however sparkling clean, and I found it very disappointing to be cleaning the bathroom having only just checked in. This property will not survive years of constant use unless the housekeeping department is trained and the cottages are cleaned properly. The bed linens were spotless as were the bathroom towels. However the level of cleanliness was not high enough. I would take travel plugs etc with you, and also extra clothes, there is no laundry facilities at all, so it is isn\'t easy to wash anything or dry clothes. Take your own pillows!!! We pre booked welcome packs and morning essentials, non of which arrived. No one speaks English on the reception desk so it was impossible to find out even a week later where they are...we pre paid for them, so we feel slightly annoyed that we have still not received a refund or an answer as to where they are....The pools are great fun, and the children had a brilliant time on the slides. The outside paving area of black slate is absolutely lethal and needs looking at immediately. We saw numerous people slipping on the slate when it becomes wet. The slides were fabulous and non stop fun for the day. The changing areas were clean and well organised. The action factory was good fun and the parks dotted around the parc were super to ride to and enjoyed by the children.The tree experience is not for the faint hearted but exhilarating for children looking for adventure. I would recommend you look at it before booking. The staff were kind and helpful at the activity centre. The boats were a lovely experience too.All of the animation is completely in French so the international children had no idea what was going on and could not join in. I would recommend the parc to at least include some international languages as they do in other countries so that all children can join in....The language skills of all the staff generally is very limited or non existent, we speak french so we could make ourselves understood most of the time although no one could understand about the welcome packages etc, but it was surprising that they did not seem to know one word of English or any other language given how many different nationalities were staying there.The restaurants were acceptable, we liked the italian style restaurant and the outside seating area of cocoon was gorgeous in the evening by the water. They kept running out of wine!! Which you do not expect in France!!! But all the staff were really nice and friendly. We would love to see a proper french restaurant there rather than burgers and chips. Some fine dining would be a wonderful addition and a reflection of the country the parc was placed in.Finding out information when you are there was quite tricky so try and do your research before you go. The queues for the reception were endless. Everywhere was quite under staffed, so expect to queue for everything.The supermarket was a marvel and brilliantly stocked with everything. There is no need to take lots of food or cleaning products from home. Everything is there and reasonably priced. The warm daily baguettes available every morning were the highlight of our mornings!!All in all we had a really great time, it was a fun and active holiday, the children will love every moment that is for sure!! We probably would return on reflection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
205;When I booked it was claimed the Parc would open in may but it has only just opened when we arrived. There is still a lot of construction taking place with no segregation to stop visitor from getting into areas still to be completed.  It is difficult to have a traffic free environment when there are builder\'s vans and trucks driving about from 6.30 in the morning.  When on my bike the first morning I had to pull off one of the paths due to a lorry coming down the other way with nowhere for me to go but into the grass at the side.  A lot of the features are still being built and staff are not prepared to apologise for any disruption caused. There doesn\'t seem to be any thing to highlight what features are ready and you only find out by turning up at them to see they are still being built.  If we had known that the park was still to be completed at the time we booked we would have gone else where.  The buffet restaurant is overpriced with very little choice.  Other restaurants don\'t seem to have much choice either.  Pool complex is good but again some area are still to be finished.  The floors in the pool area can be very slippy and we have seen a few people fall. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
206;Just back from a great holiday at Center Parcs. The site as a whole is nicely done, set in pine forest that\'s been partially cleared, and centred around a large lake that is partly nature reserve and partly navigable.To get something out of the way straight-off, two images Center Parcs use to market the site are a deer in the woods, and pictures of kids snorkelling alongside aquariums teeming with coral and marine fish.The \'cenote pool\' is a let down. For whatever reason, they didn\'t install marine aquariums but a freshwater Amazon themed tank. In my opinion the result is very dull and disappointing, so if that image is what attracted you to the site forget about it. For us it didn\'t really make a difference but they should definitely change their advertising image as right now it is totally deceptive.On the other hand there are deer (Fallow deer) in some of the areas of the parc. I get the impression that they haven\'t put them in areas where there are still some works going on but I could be wrong. We didn\'t see any while in zone G but saw deer at the bottom of our garden (just a few feet away) almost every day when things were quiet in zone A which was magical for he kids.The cottages are all semi-detached. They look small and crowded together from the outside but inside there\'s actually plenty of room and once inside you don\'t really notice the other cottages. Sound insulation between the cottages seems to be perfect. The little terrace/deck at the back is fairly private and usually faces some forest. End-of-row cottages are probably the best.We stayed in both a VIP cottage and a basic Comfort cottage. The VIP cottage was very nicely designed (just like in the photos) with a large living area and good quality fittings. The Comfort cottage was a little smaller and more basic but not bad quality. Storage space in both was a little limited. The main bedroom in the Comfort cottage had a tiny little wooden cupboard with zero hangers. Still, this is not really a big deal.The cleaning done before you arrive seems pretty perfunctory. In both cottages there was a mountain of dust under all the beds. Not a big deal, but over time the cottages may get pretty grubby. Both cottages had a microwave, hotplate, kettle, toaster, fridge and dishwasher. There\'s no air conditioning or fans, or sunshades for the big windows.The TV includes BBC1 and BBC2. It\'s not possible to change the language on the French channels which is a shame because most broadcast US TV series and films with English as an option.The VIP cottage had a little blue-tooth hifi under the TV which could be linked to a smart phone. There\'s no DVD or Blu-Ray player but if you bring a portable PC and a HDMI cable you can plug it into the TV.Mobile phone reception is patchy (1 to 3 bars). 3G connects very occasionally. They say a mast will be installed nearby in the Autumn.There\'s a paying WiFi service but one thing they don\'t mention is that you can connect to free WiFi (with your email address) in the main dome and around the Action Factory/ Creperie. This WiFi was actually lightning fast when we were there.In terms of on-site food we liked the Pizza restaurant. The choice is fairly small but the food is pretty good. The Cocoon restaurant next door had a slightly odd menu with barbeque options in the evening - if you like barbecued meat this could be a good choice but otherwise it\'s pretty limited. The Jungle Circus restaurant is a buffet set-up, a bit like Flunch. Fairly basic but okay. We didn\'t use the Quick fast food place but presumably it\'s the same as their other outlets.There\'s also a Creperie outside the dome. It\'s a lovely location in the late evening with outdoor tables near the children\'s play area but unfortunately it closes at 9pm. Would be great if it stayed open until at least 10pm in summer, and if they had a few more tables outside.The on-site Carrefour minimarket has a pretty good selection of food and household supplies although the prices are probably a little high. They had almost everything we needed.We didn\'t hire bikes but we did take a golf cart for some days. You should reserve this in advance if you want it as they are very popular.We didn\'t do that many on-site activities but we did hire an electric boat which we took around the lake and up the little river.The outdoor play area and Action Factory are great for small children. Plenty of swings and a small zip wire outside, and two different indoor play areas with foam-ball firing air cannons that seemed to delight the kids. There are also two good trampolines but these need tokens (jetons which cost 1.50 Euros each) which for now you can only buy in the arcade room next to the bowling alley in the main dome. One token gets you 6 minutes jumping, which is about enough for most kids.Aqua Mundo has several different sections. The changing areas are well done with plenty of locker space (locked using your bracelet). There\'s a central indoor pool with waves from time to time. This links to a nice outdoor pool via a little river with a circular current that the kids love to go round and round. The outdoor pool has a little slide that\'s fun for younger kids and young-at-heart adults.Back inside there\'s also a children\'s area with a couple of small slides, and water spraying everywhere. Nice for younger children.At one end of the dome there\'s four slides, two for 1.2m minimum and two for 1.4m minimum. One of each is for buoys, the others without. These slides could get pretty busy at times but if you picked your moment the wait was usually okay.Finally, there\'s the Crazy River which is a very popular feature that goes outdoors then back inside. As other reviewers have mentioned you can definitely get banged-up on this ride. It features light units which are not flush with the sides - given that the river is not even open at night this seems daft - but you soon learn to avoid bumping into these.In theory you\'re supposed to sit down in the river but if you do so you won\'t go fast, or at all, in many parts. Lying down on your front seems to work best but you will need to protect yourself from bumps as you go down. Basically if you\'re prepared to put up with a bit of bruising it\'s great fun and most people go round it again and again, which is why it can get crowded. The river closes around 8:20 to 8:30.There are plenty of places to visit in the area but don\'t rely on the on-site tourist info. The site is in the extreme north west corner of the Vienne region and all the tourist information provided is for this region. The whole Loire valley and everything to the north, east and west of the site doesn\'t exist as far as the tourist information center is concerned.If you have children I\'d highly recommend the Bioparc Zoo which is 30 minutes away, but try to avoid a really hot day. Futuroscope (which is in the Vienne region) is an hour away. There are lots of chateaux to visit in the area, with Azay-le-Rideau 45 minutes away for example. Chateau Rivau is a pretty little castle about 40 minutes away.A few negatives...Center Parcs have clearly tried to minimize staffing, with the result that if you need to arrange things at busy times you spend way too much time queuing. e.g. at the golf cart hire place the desk has just one person who has take all the details and then go out to collect the cart, drive it over and show you how to use it before he can deal with the next person in the queue. If they could just hire a second person to do the other part of the job, at least on the busy arrival days, things would go much smoother.The activity shop (Fun Shop) is annoyingly understaffed too, with just one desk to take all enquiries and to book activities. It\'s also closed two days a week plus two afternoons, and closed for lunch for two hours (have they not heard of having people work in shifts?). Clearly this saves Center Parcs some staffing costs but how many more activities would be booked if people could actually get served?The site has only been open three weeks so there\'s plenty of bare earth and small plants/trees that will grow in time. There was a digging machine working one morning when we were there but otherwise no major works in the areas we stayed. Many of the tree houses were unfinished however, with major works going on during the day in our first week but I assume this will all be finished in a week or two. This would only disturb people staying in the open tree houses for now.At the time of writing the on-site aviary was almost empty and the wildlife walk apparently devoid of wildlife but presumably this will change.Overall we really liked the site and had a great time there. I would expect it to be even better next season once the vegetation has had a chance to grow a bit and some little teething problems are sorted out.TIPS:The queues of cars trying to get in around 3pm on the arrival days can be long so it\'s probably best to arrive earlier or later. If you arrive before 3pm you can collect your welcome pack with bracelets at the gate. That way you can park in the day parking (which has shade) and visit the site. The bracelet will open the door of your cottage from 3pm. If you want to hire or collect bikes/buggies you can do this from 1pm, thus avoiding the madness when 400+ families try to do the same after 3.Checkout is by 10am. Your electronic key will stop working at this time so if you\'re not out of the cottage keep the door open.Free WIFI :There\'s a paying WiFi service but one thing they don\'t mention is that you can connect to free WiFi (with your email address) in the main dome and around the Action Factory/ Creperie. This WiFi was actually lightning fast when we were there.You can load credit on your electronic bracelet which you can then use in the on-site shops and restaurants. This works pretty well but do make sure you use it up before leaving as there\'s no refund service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
207;We booked a weekend in a premium cottage as part of our summer holidays.Our cottage in the D area was great: nice finishing and furniture plus plenty of space and a nice deck facing the woods. The place just opened so everything is brand new. The kitchen is well equiped with a large fridge, coffee maker, toaster and plenty of cutlery. A separate toilet with small details like a child toilet seat are nice extras. The only negative comment to be made is that the kitchen counter and floor were not properly cleaned. 5 minutes of additional attention from the cleaning crew could have easily fixed this and our first impression would have been perfect.The park itself is huge and the distance from the cottage to The Dome main area is quite big. Going back and forth a few times per day is simple not feasible. There are options to rent E-cars and bikes but unfortunately all cars were rented out already. If we had known upfront we would have booked the E-car. We did have the option to rent some bikes.There are plenty of activities onsite for adults and kids. They all need to be booked upfront so no queues to be expected except for those at the reservation counter. Unfortunately most of them are closed on Fridays and Mondays (arrival and departure days) and for a few hours at lunchtime. This is not very clearly mentioned on the booking website and reduces your options significantly if you only stay for the weekend.The Dome has a few restaurants which offer decent food so no real need to go offsite for dinner or lunch. Next to that there is a small supermarket which offers a wide variety of products. We had breakfast delivered to our cottage each day which was a nice little extra.In our cottage we had very poor GSM coverage and no 3G. Also there is no Wifi or wired internet available. So be prepared to be disconnected for a while. There is paid and free Wifi in the The Dome and surrounding areas. The free Wifi is pretty decent so no real need for the paid service.Conclusion: except for a few minor downsets (which could have been avoided by being more clear and open on the reservation website) we had a great stay and a wonderful weekend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
