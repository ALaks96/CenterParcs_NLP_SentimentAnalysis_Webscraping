# CenterParcs_NLP_SentimentAnalysis_Webscraping

This project was conducted in collaboration with Capgemini consulting during my Msc at Ecole Polytechnique.
We were to conduct a thorough analysis of customer reviews on Centerparc facilities.
This project is divided in days, each day corresponding to a specific task.

Several NLP methods were used in this case, ranging from T-SNE clustering, Word2Vec to Label propagation for Sentiment Analysis.
A final presentation to showcase the business value of the machine learning methods we implemented was held in front of a jury of consultants from Capgemini.
